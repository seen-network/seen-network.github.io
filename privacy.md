#### SEEN

SEEN is a volunteer-led employee network for the UK Civil Service and other public sector staff from arm’s length and other public sector bodies. We follow the Civil Service Code and Civil Service policies and procedures.

This policy explains how we use any personal information we collect about you when you use this website, register as a member of our network or take part in any events that we hold or programmes of work that we may offer in the future.

#### Our contact details

- **Name:** Sex Equality and Equity Network (SEEN), a cross-government civil service staff network
- **Address:** c/o the SEEN Data Controller (Cabinet Office), 70 Whitehall, London SW1A 2AS
- **Phone number:** To be confirmed
- **Email:** To get in touch please message us via the [Contact form](/contact) and we will respond by email. Please provide a work email address as we may not respond to messages that give private email addresses.

#### The type of personal information we collect

We currently collect and process the following information:
- Work email address
- Name
- Department

Under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR), the lawful basis we rely on for processing this information is your consent.

You are able to withdraw your consent at any time. You can do this by contacting the SEEN Steering Group via the Contact form or by writing to the address above. Please note the instructions in ['Email'](#our-contact-details) above.

We do not collect sensitive personal information, but if you volunteer it on the network (e.g. in a forum post, a blog or published meeting minutes), our legal basis for processing your sensitive personal data is because you consent to us doing so.

#### How we get the personal information and why we have it

The personal information we process is provided to us directly by you for the following reasons:
- to message us or submit an enquiry,
- to add you to our mailing list,
- to request further information about SEEN membership,
- a combination of the above.

We use the information that you have given us in order to:
- respond to your message or enquiry;
- (if you request it) email you with network updates (for example new content on our website);
- (if you request it) email you information about network membership;
- (if you are a member) email you about your membership or network business and activities;
- to maintain a list of network members;
- to invite members to meetings and events and to circulate related minutes and information as appropriate; 
- to share resources and send you information about any events we are holding or any events you may register for;
- to deliver any programmes of work in accordance with our mission and guiding principles;
- to understand who uses our website and resources, attends any events we may hold and seeks support from us, so that we can plan our work to be relevant to our membership; and
- to improve our website and email alerts.

This information is only ever shared within the SEEN network's steering group, and only for the purpose of carrying out the actions outlined above.

We may also process Aggregated Data from your personal data but this data does not reveal your identity and as such in itself is not personal data. An example of this is where we review your Usage Data to work out the percentage of website users using a specific feature of our site. If we link the Aggregated Data with your personal data so that you can be identified from it, then it is treated as personal data.

#### Data removal requests

Upon request we will at any time:
- remove anyone from our mailing list,
- revoke a membership,
- remove any personal data that we hold.

#### How we store your personal information

All personal information held is held securely and is protected. We will never reveal your identity to a third party outside our network steering group without your consent.

We will dispose your information:
- (if you are a member) within 6 months your notice to cancel your network membership;
- (if you are on our mailing list) within 6 months of your unsubscription from our mailing list;
- (if you contact us by our Contact form) within 6 months of receipt of your contact request;
- within 1 month of a data removal request.

We currently use several third party services to store and use data you provide to us, so that we can provide our services to you. [These are intended to be temporary until we are allocated a gov.uk staff email address.]  These include but are not limited to:

- GOV.UK Notify for bulk email
- Google Workspace for our email and office software

#### Your data protection rights

Under data protection law, you have rights including:

- **Your right of access** - You have the right to ask us for copies of your personal information. 
- **Your right to rectification** - You have the right to ask us to rectify personal information you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete. 
- **Your right to erasure** - You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information in certain circumstances. 
- **Your right to restriction of processing** - You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances. 
- **Your right to object to processing** - You have the the right to object to the processing of your personal information in certain circumstances.
- **Your right to data portability** - You have the right to ask that we transfer the personal information you gave us to another organisation, or to you, in certain circumstances.
- You are not required to pay any charge for exercising your rights. If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you.

Please contact us on the [Contact form](/contact/) if you wish to make a request.
