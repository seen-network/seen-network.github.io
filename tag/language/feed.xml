      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2024-03-03-james-barry-female-pioneer/">&lt;p&gt;“So tell me”, my first history professor liked to start, after hearing my latest essay, “what have you left out, and how have you filled the gaps?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to study history at university because I loved stories. My mum would tell you I loved history from an early age, but I didn’t really, I just liked stories, and history happened to be chock full of tales: tall ones, fairy ones, and true ones alike. Undergraduate history, though, started out a little…dry. Term 1 was historiography, or “the writing of history”. How dull, I thought, how tedious. I’m here to dive into a world of stories, not to philosophise about how different types of historians tell them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was (obviously) completely wrong. My tutor expertly got us to unpick the exciting idea that in telling history, one makes choices. A list of facts is an encyclopaedia, but history weaves a picture and crucially should start a conversation: you look at the evidence, you infer, and you draw conclusions. And then you discuss, because there’s no ‘one way’, and certainly not a precisely objective way, of doing those things. The process can be unconscious – some bits of the past might particularly chime, or have meaning to you – or it can be highly political, wielding history as a weapon to shore up a particular vision of the present. How we see history reflects how we see the world, and also what we want to shape the world to be. So when we’re telling historical stories, what we leave in and out, and how we fill the inevitable gaps in evidence are choices, and not neutral ones. It is personal, and it is political. What kind of historian are you? What lens are you looking through towards the past? Or, if you prefer musicals to history, let Lin Miranda Manual be the tutor: who tells your story?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where one starts and ends with the story of Dr James Barry is straightforward enough: a girl was born in the late 18th century, and dies in 1865. In between times, though, what do you include, and what do you leave out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can start with the facts, so far as they are known. Margaret Bulkley was born in Cork, Ireland, around about 1790. Her mother, Mary Anne, took her to London around 1806. This was almost certainly to claim an inheritance from her brother, the artist James Barry, who had died without leaving a will. From here, Margaret disappears, but in 1809 Mary Anne travelled to Edinburgh with a previously unknown nephew, James Barry, who enrolled in Edinburgh University medical school. After graduation, Royal College of Surgeons exams, and some time in London hospitals, James was appointed as a surgeon in the British army in 1815. What followed was a glittering army medical career around different parts of the British Empire - including one of the few c-sections of the time that left both mother and baby alive, and culminating as the prestigious inspector general of hospitals for the army - a smattering of scandal, an infamous and hot-headed meeting with Florence Nightingale, and a reputation for a bad temper, a good heart, and a zealously reforming approach to public health. And then on death – despite leaving instructions to be buried without the traditional laying out and washing - a twist: the discovery that Dr James Barry had “a perfect female body”.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are we to make of this story? An increasingly popular telling of it in recent years is that Dr James Barry was a transgender, non-binary, or queer pioneer. The Guardian, covering Historic England’s 2016 “Pride of Place” project to recognise LGBT+ history, hailed Barry as a “Secret Victorian Transgender Surgeon”.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Search for historical tours of Edinburgh, and a local tour company offers a blog to mark transgender day of visibility to “shine a light” on James, “a trans man who worked for the British army”.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; One biography of Barry argues that she may have had androgen insensitivity syndrome (a difference of sexual development, or DSD).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The National Archives, in a resource for teachers to use as a lesson plan with children aged 11-16, rejects any debate, stating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“He chose to exclusively live and identify as a man, having been assigned female at birth….. ‘Transgender’, meaning someone whose gender identity differs from the sex that they were assigned at birth, was not a term used in the 1800s. However, research has highlighted the significance of James Barry as a transgender man in the history of medicine as both a pioneer and reformer.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To take my tutor’s questions: what do these hot historical takes leave out, and how do they fill the gaps? We could start with the date. James was born around 80 years before the first women (the Edinburgh Seven) were admitted to a British medical school in 1869 (Elizabeth Garrett Anderson qualified in 1865 through private study: this route was then immediately closed to other women). Even after the Edinburgh Seven’s long fight for admission was won, the battles continued: their arrival prompted a notorious student riot, many professors refused to teach the seven women, and Edinburgh later decided the whole thing was a mistake and refused to award them the degrees they had earnt.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; No chance, then, for a girl like Margaret Bulkley to study medicine 80 years earlier in 1809 - other than by cutting off her long hair, shaving a few years off her cited age, and claiming to be male.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could also look at her life. We could consider her prospects as a girl of limited means, in a struggling family, at a time when options for women were deeply constrained. We could look, perhaps, at the evidence and suggestion that she was raped when a young teenager, giving birth to a baby in secret who was then brought up as her sister: who experiencing that trauma might not want to identify out of womanhood into the relative safety of a man with status, doing things, going places? From what we can tell of her early life, Margaret appears to be a clever, confident girl, hemmed in by her sex and class - writing to her brother, “Were I not a girl, I would be a soldier!”.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She left no account of herself that sets out her motivations: we can only infer from tiny slivers of evidence.. What do you make of her travelling with a trunk full of hidden women’s fashion plates from magazines? Or that the original plan might have been to study medicine in Edinburgh as a man for a few years, but then live and practise as a doctor in Venezuela, as a woman?&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently in the case of James Barry, the lens through which the story is currently told is firmly based in gender ideology. Even when tellings of her story try to tread a ‘neutral’ line, they end up tying themselves in knots: the University of Edinburgh’s historic alumni page posits the lengthy, fence sitting, “to give Barry the full respect they are due, and to refer to them by the correct gender, it would be useful to know if they considered themselves to be a man, or if they identified as a woman all along”.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Two of her biographers manage to state both that, “James Barry identified as a man and was indisputably transgender”, but also was “not a trans man in the full modern sense of that term”; and that Barry “enjoyed living as a man”, but “was never fully comfortable in his masculine identity”. At the end of this slightly mangled thought process, they conclude that, “had Margaret Bulkley been born in 1989…it’s likely she wouldn’t have transitioned but it’s possible that she would have lived as nonbinary”.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Right. There is no room, it seems, to examine her achievements just as one of those boring old binary women. Debate and discussion, based on evidence, is at the heart of history, but the National Archives constructs a ‘No Debate’ lesson plan, admonishing teachers and pupils that, “his biological sex became a matter of discussion…(after his death)…Such an intrusion into a person’s personal life is completely unacceptable today”.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I read different accounts of Barry’s life, it reminds me of the controversy in 2022 when the Globe theatre in London announced a production about Joan of Arc, “reimagining” her as non-binary. As Victoria Smith wrote in The Critic at the time,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In this reading, Joan is no longer an exceptional woman; by being exceptional, she is no longer a woman at all.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become a doctor more than half a century before women were formally admitted to medical schools, to have a successful career in the army 130 years before women were recognised as a permanent part of the British armed forces&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and to carve out a life outside the confines of sexist gender roles at a point in history when women were fundamentally constrained by them, is an extraordinary achievement by any measure. The personal toll of it – not least in the difficulty in forming close relationships, but also in living the opposite of an ‘authentic life’ – must have been substantial: to maintain it undiscovered, until your death, would have required immense determination and courage. And so, naturally, it has to be taken away. Not an extraordinary woman at all, not someone proving what women were capable of in extremis: someone, instead, who opted out of womanhood altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a political choice to claim James Barry as transgender or non-binary, and to use masculine or neutral pronouns for her. It is a censorious political choice to attempt to shut down historians proposing other interpretations, that focus on other motivations, or look at the context in which she forged a life for herself, over a possible interpretation of gender identity. That people so frequently do so (and present it as progress) makes me uncomfortable as a historian: as a woman and a feminist, it makes me angry. History is full of women pretending to be men, or aping male clothes and behaviour, both temporarily and permanently. They did it for reasons of safety, ambition, opportunity, money, necessity, and personal fulfilment. I don’t know whether any of them would recognise a modern concept of gender identity, and neither, of course, does any historian claiming them to be trans or non-binary. I don’t think it is, as the University of Edinburgh and the National Archives suggest, disrespectful to refer to James Barry as a woman: I think it’s far more disrespectful to co-opt her for a political movement that seeks to prioritise gender identity over sex, and erases as it does so both the achievements of women, and a long history of gender non-conformity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said earlier that history was a conversation. My contribution to that conversation is this: we should say, loudly, and with admiration, that James Barry was a woman. We should tell our daughters: look, even in the most constrained of circumstances, look what women can do. Look what women can achieve. And how wonderful that you, 21st century girl, no longer need to opt out of womanhood to be any kind of pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>/posts/menopause-a-radical-perspective</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2024-01-17-menopause-a-radical-perspective/">&lt;p&gt;As a 47-year-old woman, it’s not surprising that I’m heartened by the increasing visibility and normalisation of menopause – whether I like it or not, that train is pulling into the station some time soon. But the litany of common problems – the brain fog, the sleeplessness, the pains and sweats – that sounds like a bad cosmic joke, that each new chapter of female life must open with a new swathe of physical inconvenience. Is nature itself a misogynist? No wonder most world religions contend that women are being punished for some original sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would want to be a girl? No matter how much my mum insisted slightly desperately that ‘being a girl is just as good as being a boy,’ it just didn’t ring true. How can it be as good? I’m doomed to be weaker, and fatter! I could be attacked, or raped. I have to deal with periods, I could get pregnant. If I ever want a child I’ll &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to get pregnant. Women get paid less, taken less seriously, expected to shave their legs and wear make-up to look ‘normal’. Name me just one thing that is better for girls! See!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a teenager I was grimly determined to compensate for my bad luck at the sex lottery, the cruel roulette that had put an X chromosome in the way of my human self-actualisation. On my grandparents’ farm I hefted haybales on my own, not one-between-two like mere aunties and mums. I wore trousers with my Venture Scouts uniform, and hauled a superabundance of sanitary products and painkillers on all-day hikes. At school I marched the other way whenever I saw creepy Mr Richards, who addressed all the girls while looking directly at their breasts. I tried, repeatedly, to explain to priapic teenage boys in pub car parks that I thought we were friends. At university I wore a bristling leather jacket and made it clear I could walk home on my own, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was studying political philosophy, especially the development of post-Enlightenment concepts of the ‘political individual’, who could consent to mutual obligations rather than owing duty to a lord. Foundational thinkers such as Locke and Rousseau had banished women as a sex to the ‘private sphere’, on the basis that they were by nature too emotional, too unruly, to partake in public life (and, presumably, because otherwise there would be no-one to clean the houses and raise the children of the Great Men).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing my dissertation, I came across feminist political theorist Carole Pateman. Pateman’s thesis was that the Great Men didn’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; exclude women from political personhood out of prejudice and expediency. Rather, the individual they defined had specifically male characteristics which women could not share. Pateman wrote that “the body of the ‘individual’ is very different from women’s bodies. His body is tightly enclosed within boundaries, but women’s bodies are permeable, their contours change shape and they are subject to cyclical processes. All these differences are summed up in the natural bodily process of birth.” I thought this was reductive nonsense. What if women don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; shifting contours and cyclical processes? What if they would like to reproduce (if at all) on an equal basis with men? It seemed a bit embarrassing that these middle-aged feminists were wanging on about some female birth-giving energy or whatever – wouldn’t it be better to stop framing all that icky, painful business as ‘female’, so that it didn’t hold individual women back from their potential? It seemed obvious to me that the solution was not, as Pateman recommended, to create two political actors, one of each sex, but to make sure the political individual was neutral, unsexed, to accommodate all shades of glorious human diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I moved through my 20s, though, my sex continued, stubbornly, to affect my life. I wasn’t doing feminine things – hell, I wasn’t even doing specifically female things like having periods or, god forbid, children. And yet I still had to think differently, act differently to men, to navigate my reality – the man who flashed at me as I walked home from the Tube station, or the one who found it funny to follow me along the dark road, didn’t seem to know or care what I felt about my boundaries, permeable or otherwise. I started to become less resentful of my own bad luck to be female, and more angry at how a supposedly liberal society treated female people in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘ladette’ feminism of the 90s emphasised personal freedom and equity – individual women having the same choices and opportunities as men, without being judged to a different standard. But that liberal feminism didn’t explain to me the root cause of women’s mistreatment – even in Cool Britannia, there didn’t seem to be a choice I could make that would give me men’s freedoms, so how could more ‘choices’ help the women of Afghanistan, Somalia or Nepal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was radical (‘of the root’) feminist analysis that finally, to me, made sense of the global systematic oppression of female people. Drawing on Marxist thinking, radical feminism uses class analysis, where a class is a set of people (or things) that meet specific criteria. Importantly, something that is true of the class doesn’t need to be true of all the individual members of that class. For example, the class ‘homo sapiens’, defined as all living humans, has two eyes – it doesn’t tend to have two eyes, or generally have two eyes; it has two eyes. That doesn’t mean that all humans have two eyes, or that anyone with just one eye is not human, or that the purpose or destiny of humans is to have eyes. In all sexually dimorphic species, the female is defined as the kind of organism that produces large gametes (e.g. eggs). So it’s the class of female humans which gestates young and gives birth – that doesn’t mean all female humans give birth, or that anyone who doesn’t give birth isn’t female, or that giving birth is the purpose or destiny of female humans. But it does mean female humans as a class can be, and are, exploited and subordinated in patriarchal systems – regardless of any individual woman’s real or perceived personal characteristics or reproductive status. That’s precisely why there isn’t an opt-out, no matter how much I might have wanted one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class analysis allows you to see the wood for the trees and examine powerful structures in society without getting distracted by individual variations. It loses some value when the class is porous or can’t be clearly defined – that’s one of the reasons why I’m not a political Marxist or even a socialist (which I’m sure would disappoint my Great Uncle ‘Red’ Eddie, firebrand of the General Strike). My lefty interventionist liberalism reflects my optimism that no-one is fixed forever into a particular socio-economic category. We won’t need to liberate the labouring class if we can effectively abolish it – or at the very least provide means of escape. The same isn’t true of sex class – regardless of our identity, personality or social presentation, it’s not possible in humans to change the material condition of our sex. Glorious human diversity takes place within and across sex classes, and there is powerful intersectionality with other characteristics. But Pateman was right*, in that there’s no point unsexing the political individual when we can’t unsex ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there can be no escape from our sex, there has to be liberation &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; our sex, so that its exploitation doesn’t limit our humanity – structural change to remedy the oppression of women as a sex class. This starts with Marie Shear’s definition of feminism – the radical notion that women are people. That as a sex, we are a whole class of human people in our own right, not a variant or a sub-category (non-men), not a state of mind, and not a shifting collection of whichever individuals happen at a given time to have certain working organs or be manifesting particular bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is the context for my own perspective on how we need, collectively, to re-imagine menopause. Yes, of course more awareness of symptoms and greater support for colleagues is wonderful. But we need to take on the challenge of how menopause (among other things) represents the fusion of female biology and female exploitation. Periods, pregnancy and menopause are the foundations for the ancient folk archetypes of the maiden, the mother and the crone. The trivialisation of menopause is intertwined with the invisibility of older women, and the contempt in which they are held in society as a whole. We need to understand and manage menopause as an integral part of female experience, not as another ineffable ordeal that women must fight against and overcome in order to entertain the hopeful fiction that they, too, might be fully human.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*I still disagree with aspects of Pateman’s thesis, but for more nuanced reasons that I don’t have space for here.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">As a 47-year-old woman, it’s not surprising that I’m heartened by the increasing visibility and normalisation of menopause – whether I like it or not, that train is pulling into the station some time soon. But the litany of common problems – the brain fog, the sleeplessness, the pains and sweats – that sounds like a bad cosmic joke, that each new chapter of female life must open with a new swathe of physical inconvenience. Is nature itself a misogynist? No wonder most world religions contend that women are being punished for some original sin.</summary>

      <updated>2023-12-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/posts/what-gender-critical-means-to-me</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-12-18-what-gender-critical-means-to-me/">&lt;p&gt;After another week of having to explain again to managers and HR staff what gender critical beliefs are and are not, I thought it would be helpful to put together this primer in case it is of use to others. The term ‘gender critical’ covers a range of views and I don’t speak for everyone, and nor am I a spokesperson for SEEN. But I think the views I explain here are fairly representative of those I have met in SEEN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-sex-and-gendergender-identity-are-different-things&quot;&gt;1. Sex and gender/gender identity are different things&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stonewall define transgender as &lt;em&gt;“An umbrella term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not sit comfortably with, the sex they were assigned at birth”&lt;/em&gt;, so they are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-everyone-has-a-biological-sex&quot;&gt;2. Everyone has a biological sex&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex, whether you are male or female, is your biology and is observable and measurable. Everyone has a biological sex that is fixed from the point of conception and recorded at birth. A small proportion of people have one of the rare medical conditions known as Differences of Sexual Development (DSD), but people with DSD’s are still male or female.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone (whether or not they believe in the concept of &lt;em&gt;gender identity&lt;/em&gt;, and whatever their gender identity is, if they have one) can experience sexism, bullying and harassment or discrimination on the basis of their sex. This may be the sexism that a woman faces due to stereotypes about her sex, or the sexism a transwoman (someone registered male at birth who considers themselves to have a female gender identity) faces because they do not follow the sex-based stereotypes associated with their sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex is a protected characteristic. Sex is also the basis of the protected characteristics of sexual orientation (opposite-, same- or both-sex attracted) and maternity and pregnancy (which only applies to women).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is vital that we are able to talk about sex when relevant to our employment and that our employers provide us all with the sex-based protections in place in law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-some-people-believe-they-have-a-gender-identity&quot;&gt;3. Some people believe they have a gender identity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender identity is defined by Stonewall as &lt;em&gt;“A person’s innate sense of their own gender, whether male, female or something else, which may or may not correspond to the sex assigned at birth.”&lt;/em&gt; Gender identity cannot be observed or measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people believe in the concept of gender identity, and some people do not. Some people that do hold this belief, consider that their gender identity does not match their sex, and they may describe themselves as transgender or non-binary, cisgender, or something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic. Someone with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment may hold a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC), or they may not. Either way, no one should face bullying, harassment or discrimination because their gender identity does not match their sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belief in the concept of gender identity may also be a protected belief under the Equality Act. No one should face bullying, harassment or discrimination due to their belief in the concept of gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, a belief in gender identity should not be assumed or imposed on employees. The civil service has a duty to remain neutral both for its staff and for those we serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-some-people-have-gender-critical-beliefs&quot;&gt;4. Some people have Gender Critical beliefs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those with gender critical beliefs do not subscribe to the concept of gender identity. They think that gender identity must not be conflated with or used to replace sex in law, policy, guidance or elsewhere. If there is a need to segregate men and women for reasons of privacy, dignity, safety or safeguarding it is sex that should be used (and which is permitted under the Equality Act), not self-identified gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender critical beliefs are a protected belief under the Equality Act. Noone should face bullying, harassment or discrimination due to their lack of belief in the concept of gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I do not hold a belief in gender identity, this does not mean I do not acknowledge the existence of transgender or non-binary people. My lack of Christian faith does not mean I deny the existence of Christians. Of course Christians exist, but their existence does not prove the existence of a Christian God. Equally, my lack of belief in innate gender identity does not mean I deny the existence of transgender or non-binary colleagues. Everyone should be treated with respect. But someone’s beliefs about their own gender identity do not override the protections written into law on the basis of sex, nor my (lack of) belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to me, gender critical beliefs are simply about expecting my employer to apply the sex-based protections afforded to us all in law, and not imposing a belief system on me that I do not share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="/posts/2023-11-28-idevaw-language-matters/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Violence against women and girls - language matters" />
      <published>2023-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2023-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/posts/idevaw-language-matters</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-11-28-idevaw-language-matters/">&lt;p&gt;Language matters when we talk about violence against women and girls. In the last 15 years we have seen the word woman not being used, replaced with the word people or non-man, or replaced with dehumanising body-part terms such as cervix havers, chestfeeders, pregnant people or menstruators.  Attempting to eradicate biological sex by not naming women as women doesn’t make all the nasty, horrible things disappear and it does not give equality to women. The violence and rapes still happen it just means it is harder to measure something that is not defined. When it comes to violence against women and girls if we cannot name those who are being violated it makes it very difficult to defend them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago a local campaign near me decided to drop the word woman and use the higher level term ‘gender-based violence’ to highlight violence against women and girls. (Gender-based violence covers violence against males and females.) Fantastic branded signs adorned our bus stops and public buildings but no one knew what the campaign was about. It was a waste of resources and money. By taking out the word woman the campaign had forgotten who the victims were - women and why they were victims - because of their sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prison statistics for England and Wales show that 99% of sexual offenders are male&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and we know that 88% of those offended against in such cases are female.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  These figures are replicated around the world.  We cannot deny the biological difference here, men are the perpetrators, females are the victims. In the UK rape can only be committed by males.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; When a man rapes a woman he does so because of her biology not because of what she is referred to as. Women are oppressed and violated on the basis of their sex and to deny they have a sex by not using the word woman is gaslighting, which is another form of abuse. A male human is capable of killing a woman with his bare hands and we know that in the UK three women a week are murdered by a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pornography is having a massive impact on violence against women and girls. Over 88% of pornography scenes show sexual violence towards women.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Strangulation, beating and rape are the norm in pornography. One in three children have watched ‘hardcore’ pornography by the age of 12.  We are in an era where violence against women and girls is being normalised at an early age in the palm of our children’s hands. Boys are learning that girls can be objectified, humiliated, and attacked physically and sexually. Both boys and girls are learning that it is ‘normal’ for sex to hurt and that violence during sex is ‘normal’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to reduce violence against women and girls we have to use sex based language. To acknowledge biological sex matters and language matters helps us name the problem and find solutions. We have to be honest with our children about the harms of pornography and have conversations with them at a much younger age. We have to give them the language to reject the use of pornography so our boys can grow into adult men who can have a functioning sex life and our girls do not live in fear of their next sexual encounter. If women and girls are to achieve equality we have to significantly reduce violence against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <published>2023-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2023-10-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/posts/lets-talk-about-pronouns</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-10-18-lets-talk-about-pronouns/">&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of Monday, 9th October we approached everyone on our mailing list to ask them what they thought about practices related to the statement of pronouns in email signatures and elsewhere.  One thing was immediately clear: this was something many had been burning to talk about!  Within 3 hours we’d had close to 50 responses, and from there they continued coming in steadily until we received our 100th contribution on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had such a brilliant selection of answers, we’d like to share some of them in full, alongside a general summary and some overall themes. None of the comments included are from the SEEN Steering Group (we’ll follow up with some of our opinions at a later date).  We’ve attributed contributors in the way they’ve asked us to (be that first names, initials or just anonymous). Not all of them reflect views held within SEEN’s steering group, but we wanted to publish a varied selection to promote debate and showcase the diverse perspectives on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impartiality-and-the-cs-code&quot;&gt;Impartiality and the CS Code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over three quarters of respondents highlighted what they see as the political nature of pronoun declaration and the associated ideology underpinning it (that is, belief in gender identity), with the view that this was not considered appropriate in an impartial Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of these comments include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘It does often feel like we have to show support regardless of if we agree with the cause and in an impartial Civil Service I don’t think that’s right’ – Anonymous, Home Office&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘We don’t indicate our affiliation with other ideological beliefs on official emails, e.g. which political or religious ideology we support. It is unnecessary for us to do our jobs and shouldn’t be encouraged as we are public servants who should strive to be as impartial as possible on all matters.’ – Anonymous, DSTL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘As civil servants we are expected to remain politically impartial, a simple rule to which I am careful to adhere. Plastering your beliefs on every email sent out does not imply a political impartiality, quite the opposite.’ – Anonymous, APHA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Senior managers should be aware of the pressure that this display of partisan support for one side of this highly political issue places on other staff members to avoid expressing non-conforming views.  Senior Civil Servants (in particular) should be scrupulously neutral, and pronoun declarations are anything but.’ – Emma, HMRC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I see no reason why I should advertise where I stand on an issue which is going to be a political hot potato in the run up to the next election.’ – Gill, MOJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These highlight that the adding of pronouns is considered by many to be far from a neutral step, especially when adopted by senior management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sexism-womens-rights-and-sex-stereotypes&quot;&gt;Sexism, women’s rights and sex stereotypes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of our members see stating pronouns as a clear indicator of a belief in gender identity (and that this should always take precedence over sex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a third of respondents highlighted how they believed the pushing / attempted enforcement of gender identity beliefs was having a detrimental effect on the rights of women in the workplace. Notably, a number of women in STEM from the MOD highlighted this, including Liz and Clare. Liz said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘As a female in engineering, I am normally in the minority.  Although overt sexism within engineering is no way near as bad as it once was, use of pronouns highlights that I’m not in the ‘boys club’ as even now there is a general belief that engineering is not for women.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clare had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I have experienced a lot of sexism throughout my career in IT and seriously considered going by my gender-neutral middle name before joining the civil service. I decided not to, but I still consider that reinforcing that someone is female exposes them to implicit bias and potential disadvantage. I also think that declaring pronouns is like declaring your star sign, if there was a climate where expressing a lack of belief in horoscopes could lead to a person being disciplined or even fired from their jobs. It’s reliant on a belief and therefore very divisive and because it’s known that some people feel so passionately about it, it’s a reminder that those people could hate you or harbour a grudge against you.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many who highlighted this angle also expressed their concerns about how encouraging the use of pronouns (and thus implying belief in gender identity) was distressing, as it implied a &lt;em&gt;‘right’&lt;/em&gt; way to be a man or a woman, tied to stereotypes of femininity/masculinity, such as &lt;em&gt;‘FF, MoJ’&lt;/em&gt; who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘It promotes an ideology that if you are female who does not [reflect] social roles and stereotypes of femininity you are not a woman, [and] similarly if you are a man who rejects the social roles of masculinity then you are not a man.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;homophobialgbt-concerns&quot;&gt;Homophobia/LGBT concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of gay and lesbian members also wrote to express that, in addition to sexism, they believed the practice was also a signpost for homophobia, such as &lt;em&gt;‘Anonymous, DWP’&lt;/em&gt; who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Lesbians are being banned from creating lesbian only events. As a gay man, listing my pronouns would feel like publicly supporting an ideology that seeks to erase gays and lesbians.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several members also expressed their concerns for those who have gender dysphoria or are struggling with issues around identity, and how the enforcement of this practice may make them uncomfortable, such as &lt;em&gt;‘Anonymous from DEFRA’&lt;/em&gt; who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I worry that encouraging people to add pronouns to emails or provide them in introductions places undue pressure on those who are still working through issues of gender dysphoria. It’s not work’s place to ‘out’ people in this way.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others highlighted that while the practice of pronoun declaration made them uncomfortable, they still had great sympathy for those struggling with gender dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;autism-and-neurodiversity&quot;&gt;Autism and neurodiversity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of respondents also highlighted how people with autism or other neurodiverse conditions can struggle with preferred pronouns that do not match a person’s clearly observed sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Anonymous from Scottish Government’&lt;/em&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I have always used pronouns in line with my presumption of someone’s sex except where it is clear they wish me to do something different. In that case I tend to default to using their first name repeatedly as using their preferred pronouns makes me feel complicit in a lie which is probably more awkward for me as my autism makes me very reluctant to dissemble.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;‘Kate from DEFRA’&lt;/em&gt; commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I also really feel for people with neurodivergence such as autism, I know a lot of folk are worried that they will accidentally misgender someone and with CS buying into the Stonewall narrative that accidentally ‘misgendering’ someone is transphobic I worry that the pronoun pushing will get these folks in trouble and potentially on a disciplinary.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-culture-of-fear&quot;&gt;A culture of fear&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many members highlighted the culture of fear that is created around pronoun declaration and associated beliefs about gender identity. Some described having faced direct discrimination and harassment from colleagues for refusing to participate in pronoun declarations to the extent that they are now scared or concerned when they interact with someone who has pronouns in their signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘AG from UK Export Finance’&lt;/em&gt; commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘it shouldn’t be done… Additionally, the threats when pronouns aren’t included or added by those that want them to be is horrific.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘NM from DEFRA’&lt;/em&gt; was one of the many people who expressed the view that it led to exclusion, rather than inclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I feel the use of pronouns in the workplace is unnecessary and alienating to many people. It does not create an inclusive culture, but instead a culture of fear and isolation’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of links to external blogs that appeared to push the practice was something also raised by many, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/gender-pronouns-in-workplace&quot;&gt;this blog from Culture Amp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other SEEN members have queried why blogs like the above are allowed, whereas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filia.org.uk/latest-news/2021/12/1/should-you-declare-your-pronouns-a-simple-guide&quot;&gt;blogs like this&lt;/a&gt; aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;support-for-preferred-pronouns&quot;&gt;Support for preferred pronouns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the overwhelming response from those who disagreed with the declaration of pronouns, we also received a handful of responses which said they didn’t mind pronouns in other people’s signatures, as long as they weren’t expected to declare pronouns themselves, and as long as they could still accurately describe someone’s sex in situations where relevant.  We also received four contributions strongly in favour of use of pronouns in signatures and work profiles, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEEN welcomes a plurality of views and opinions, and we also look to seek tolerance and understanding between those with differing views.  For these reasons, we have also  included two perspectives in favour of pronouns below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Will from MoJ’&lt;/em&gt; had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Another potential benefit of having everyone record their pronouns on their profile is that should someone feel the need to challenge whether someone was using the ‘correct’ facilities in the workplace because they were spending too much time in them themselves to mind their own business and return to work, they would be able to confirm how they identify against their profile (if they knew who the individual was) and avoid making a mistake in thinking someone was in a space they shouldn’t have been. If someone was to then bring an issue like this up to management etc to ‘deal with’ they would be able to challenge back about what they themselves were doing in the facilities for so long to be able to notice when they should only be in those facilities to do their business and then return to work, ensuring everyone is protected from those who loiter in the facilities and report them to the police if necessary.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘John (they/them) from MoJ’&lt;/em&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I am non-binary and I include my pronouns in my email signature and it is also configured to appear in Teams via an option in my Global Address List Entry. It allows colleagues to correctly gender me in meetings without me having to state my pronouns regularly or correct them if they initially assume I use different pronouns. This makes me feel much more included, less stressed, and less awkward.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many will have sympathy for John and will choose to add pronouns for the purpose of kindness.  However,  &lt;em&gt;‘Anonymous, DESNZ’&lt;/em&gt; has a different view of the result of such intentions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My line manager, a pleasant bloke with young children, has ‘pronouns he/him’ after his name on his email signature. Next to it, he has carefully made a hyperlink marked ‘Why do I do this?’, which links to a political blog about ‘allyship’. Whenever an email from him pops up, there also pops up the ‘pronouns he/him’. And every time his name and pronouns pop up on my screen, I get a lurch of dread in my stomach and fight back tears. My lovely, fragile young niece comes into my mind again, I feel helpless, and I can’t concentrate on my work. My teenaged, soon-to-be-adult niece, who has for years struggled with depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We all helped and supported her as best as we could and hoped maturity and time would work its magic and foster her growing into the strong, healthy young woman we know she can be, just like a million awkward teenagers before her have grown up and worked it out.  Instead, she got caught up in the gender identity movement and is trapped in an alternate universe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now she feels ‘special’ and ‘chosen’, rather than just an awkward ugly duckling who got teased by the cool kids. Now she is praised for her ‘bravery’ by the cool kids at her new 6th Form and they tell her the rest of the world is against her and only her ‘allies’ will defend her.   […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We try still to hold her as close as we can and tell her we love her just the way she is, and that she doesn’t need to pretend to be a boy for the world to accept her. We hope we can keep hold of her before she is old enough to buy cross-sex hormones or get on a surgery waiting list to have her breasts chopped off. She threatens both on her darkest days, full of weeping and panic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Does my line manager know about girls like my niece? Every day, I think, I must talk to him. But what can I say, when our workplace policies allow and encourage ‘pronouns’? He has also been praised as ‘brave’, for being ‘a good ally to vulnerable people’. Does he know how this violent political movement of gender identity, that he so casually promotes with his ‘pronouns’, damages vulnerable girls like my niece? If he doesn’t know, why doesn’t he bother to find out? If he does know, how can he be so callous?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank you all for your honesty and engagement in this issue.  Watch out for Part 2 (coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>/posts/manifestation</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-10-16-manifestation/">&lt;p&gt;A frequent area of discussion and dispute around gender critical views is whether and how much they can be expressed (or &lt;em&gt;‘manifested’&lt;/em&gt; to use the legal term) in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no simple answer to this question as each situation will turn on its own unique facts, but the caselaw is clear that there can be no blanket prohibition on the expression of gender critical views.  There might be circumstances where there is a good reason to curtail the expression of gender critical views (or indeed another protected belief).  However, any actions to curtail any protected belief cannot be taken lightly.  It must have a clear justification and must be proportionate.  A careful consideration of the facts will be needed before making any decision, to minimise legal risk and avoid creating unfairness and inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article focuses on what the law currently says on the expression of gender critical beliefs and highlights areas of legal ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-right-to-freedom-of-thoughts-belief-and-religion&quot;&gt;The right to freedom of thoughts, belief and religion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principle that lies behind the right to manifest a protected belief is the right to freedom of thought, belief and religion.  The right to express all protected beliefs in some way is enshrined in Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (&lt;em&gt;“ECHR”&lt;/em&gt;), which includes the right to not only privately hold a belief, but to manifest it publicly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This right has been integrated into the Equality Act 2010 (&lt;em&gt;“Equality Act”&lt;/em&gt;) which makes ‘religion and belief’ a ‘protected characteristic’ under s.4.  The scope of ‘religion and belief’ is defined in s.10 and in caselaw and includes any religion or religious or philosophical belief&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, including a lack of belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-expression-of-gender-critical-beliefs&quot;&gt;The expression of gender critical beliefs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turning now to gender critical views.  When considering if conduct restricting the expression of gender critical beliefs is lawful, there are two tests.  The first is whether gender critical views are ‘protected’ by the Equality Act.  The second is whether the precise way they are being manifested is lawful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;are-gender-critical-beliefs-protected-by-law&quot;&gt;Are gender critical beliefs protected by law?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the law is settled, and the answer straightforward: yes they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test for whether a belief falls under s.10 and qualifies for protection under the Equality Act is set out in the case of &lt;em&gt;Grainger&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;  Gender critical beliefs – the belief that biological sex is real, important and immutable – qualifies for protection under s.10 following the well-known case of &lt;em&gt;Forstater&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manifestation-of-gender-critical-beliefs&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Manifestation”&lt;/em&gt; of gender critical beliefs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether a belief is protected is only the first limb to consider.  There is also the question of whether and how a belief can be manifested.   It is here that the law is more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the question of what ‘manifestation’ actually means.  Legally speaking, the term is broad when applied to beliefs and covers a wide range of ways in which a protected belief is expressed or made known to others.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing the law is clear on is that the right to manifest protected beliefs is extremely important.  As the case of &lt;em&gt;Higgs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; highlighted (in relation to the Equality Act), the freedom to manifest a protected belief and to express views relating to that belief are &lt;em&gt;“essential rights in any democracy, whether or not the belief in question is popular or mainstream and even if its expression may offend”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important and worth reflecting on, because it is sometimes suggested that the opposite applies to gender critical views.  Although the belief that biological sex is real, immutable and important is widely held, it is sometimes claimed that this is a controversial view which could cause offence to some people, and it is therefore always inappropriate to express this view in the workplace.  This is not the case.  The Courts have set a high threshold for the restriction of the manifestation of a protected belief, including gender critical beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while the expression of protected beliefs is regarded as a fundamental democratic right, it can nevertheless be lawfully curtailed in limited circumstances. To understand the circumstances in which this can happen, the first step is to return to where the concept originates, in the ECHR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Article 9 and Article 10 of the ECHR are &lt;em&gt;qualified&lt;/em&gt; rights, which means they can be restricted provided the following three tests are met.  The restriction in question must be:
prescribed by law;
in the pursuit of a &lt;em&gt;legitimate&lt;/em&gt; aim; and,
necessary in a democratic society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any interference must also be &lt;em&gt;proportionate&lt;/em&gt; (see endnote &lt;a href=&quot;#bank-mellat-v-hmt-2013-uksc-39&quot;&gt;Bank Mellat v HMT 2013&lt;/a&gt;).  The principles to be applied in deciding whether an interference is ‘proportionate’ are set out in detail in the Employment Appeals Tribunal case of &lt;em&gt;Higgs&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;#higgs-v-farmores-school-2023-eat-89&quot;&gt;seen endnote&lt;/a&gt;), in which the Tribunal said that there are a number of tests that need to be met, and that serious thought and consideration should be given to all these factors by any organisation seeking to introduce a policy restricting the manifestation of belief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is, in short, not a decision to take lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-about-some-practical-advice-for-example-on-issues-such-as-misgendering&quot;&gt;What about some practical advice, for example on issues such as misgendering?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The law remains big on principles and tests, and relatively sparse on precise examples, although more cases are slowly testing the parameters of gender critical beliefs and their expression.  However, the Courts have given some indication of the type of conduct that would be a permissible manifestation of a protected belief and what would not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Forstater&lt;/em&gt;, the Employment Appeal Tribunal (&lt;em&gt;“EAT”&lt;/em&gt;) was clear that &lt;strong&gt;there cannot be a blanket ban on the expression of gender critical beliefs&lt;/strong&gt; (or indeed any protected belief).   We have highlighted this, because there continue to be instances where it is suggested that gender critical beliefs simply don’t have an active and visible place in the workplace.  The law states that they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some claims to the contrary, the EAT in the case of &lt;em&gt;Forstater&lt;/em&gt; did not find that it is never okay to misgender in the workplace.  In fact, the EAT concluded that referring to a person by their biological sex, rather than their preferred gender, &lt;em&gt;would &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; necessarily constitute conduct that could justifiably be curtailed&lt;/em&gt;.  Whether it was acceptable or not would depend entirely on the circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally importantly, &lt;em&gt;the fact that others might be offended by gender critical views&lt;/em&gt; is entirely subjective and does not, in itself, give rise to any justification to restrict the expression of that belief.  The EAT was very clear that the Claimant (Maya Forstater) could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be required to refer to a transwoman as a woman (or face accusations of harassment), as &lt;em&gt;this would constitute a blanket ban on the expression of her belief which could not possibly be proportionate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This said, everyone in the workplace (whatever their protected beliefs, or lack thereof) are subject to the same prohibitions on discrimination, victimisation and harassment under the Equality Act.   It is important to state that &lt;em&gt;deliberate and gratuitous ‘misgendering’&lt;/em&gt; (referring to a transgender person as their biological sex, or conversely – and equally – referring to a gender critical person or a person who does not believe in gender identity theory as &lt;em&gt;‘cis’&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; constitute harassment.  The same is likely to be true of attempts to exert pressure on colleagues to convert to a particular protected belief&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, something that would be as true for those with gender critical beliefs as those who believe passionately in ideas around gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forstater&lt;/em&gt; is the best-known case on manifestation of gender critical beliefs, but further guidance can be found in two other subsequent cases, Mackareth&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and Fahmy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.  More are likely to follow, as case law is developing on this point.  In &lt;em&gt;Fahmy&lt;/em&gt;, the Employment Tribunal found that an employee had been subjected to harassment for holding and expressing gender critical beliefs at work. Other employees had described the Claimant’s gender critical views as &lt;em&gt;“anti-trans”&lt;/em&gt; and compared her beliefs to racism, sexism and other forms of bigotry and the Employment Tribunal found that this response to the Claimant’s gender critical beliefs &lt;em&gt;“went beyond the reasonable expression of a personal opinion in terms which were highly derogatory”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both gender critical beliefs and their manifestation are protected by the law, which means that any limitation imposed on the way in which gender critical views can be manifested must be prescribed by law and necessary for the protection of the rights of others (and meet the additional tests, such as proportionality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst the law is now settled on whether gender critical beliefs are protected, the question on how far they can be expressed or manifest, remains complex and nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each situation turns on its individual facts and there are no blanket prohibitions or impunities as to exactly how a person may manifest gender critical beliefs or when curtailments will be justified.  However, two things are clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, anyone who suggests that gender critical beliefs can be held but should not be manifested in the workplace (for whatever reason) is just wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, there is no hierarchy of rights or protected characteristics.  Employers should not make the mistake of prioritising the interests, feelings or perspectives of one protected group or set of beliefs over another, for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reason.  This is also true of decisions on when and how protected beliefs can be manifested.  Not only is this a fundamental part of a democratic society, it is essential in an inclusive, diverse and politically impartial Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bank-mellat-v-hmt-2013-uksc-39&quot;&gt;Bank Mellat v HMT [2013] UKSC 39&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/39.html&quot;&gt;this case&lt;/a&gt; the Supreme Court identified the correct test for proportionality in this context as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the objective of the measure sufficiently important to justify the limitation of a protected right?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is the measure rationally connected to the objective?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Could a less intrusive measure have been used without unacceptably compromising the achievement of the objective?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Whether, balancing the severity of the measure’s effects on the rights of the persons to whom it applies against the importance of the objective, to the extent that the measure will contribute to its achievement, the former outweighs the latter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;higgs-v-farmores-school-2023-eat-89&quot;&gt;Higgs v Farmore’s School [2023] EAT 89&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/employment-appeal-tribunal-decisions/mrs-kristie-higgs-v-1-farmors-school-2-archbishops-council-of-the-church-of-england-2023-eat-89-eat-89&quot;&gt;This case&lt;/a&gt; concerned a Christian employee who had been suspended and subsequently dismissed for gross misconduct by her employer (a school) because she had posted on social media about her views on ‘gender fluidity’ and same sex marriage.  The ET had found that the Claimant had not been discriminated against or harassed because of her protected belief, as there was not a sufficient nexus between her belief and the way in which she had manifested them. On appeal, the EAT found that the ET had taken the wrong approach and has remitted the case back to the ET for a proper determination of whether the Claimant’s dismissal was because of the manifestation of her protected belief or because of a justified objection to the way in which her belief was manifested, i.e. was the dismissal a proportionate response to the manifestation of a protected belief. (At the time of writing the case is ongoing).  In reaching its decision the EAT followed the proportionality test set out in Mellat, and at para 94 set out the following principles to be considered when considering proportionality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;“foundational nature of the rights”&lt;/em&gt; must be recognised. The freedom to manifest a protected belief and to express views relating to that belief are &lt;em&gt;“essential rights in any democracy, whether or not the belief in question is popular or mainstream and even if its expression may offend”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Where the restriction of a protected belief is justified, the curtailment is due to the objectionable manner of the manifestation, and not the exercise of the right to hold/manifest a protected belief.  In other words, you cannot restrict the right to hold a protected belief, nor to express it.  The only expressions or manifestations that can be restricted are where those manifestations that are objectionable.  (More on what makes a manifestation ‘objectionable’ below).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The question of whether a limitation on the manifestation of a protected belief is justified will always be context-specific and therefore a proportionality assessment must pay careful attention to the individual facts of a case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The following questions must then be asked:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;is the objective the employer seeks to achieve is sufficiently important to justify the limitation of the right in question;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;is the limitation rationally connected to that objective;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;could a less intrusive limitation be imposed without undermining the achievement of the objective in question; and&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;when balancing the severity of the limitation on the rights of the worker concerned against the importance of the objective, does the former outweighs the latter.
 All of these tests must be satisfied if the restriction is to be considered proportionate.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Regard should be had to:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the content of the manifestation;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the tone used;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the extent of the manifestation;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the worker’s understanding of the likely audience;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the extent and nature of the intrusion on the rights of others, and any consequential impact on the employer’s ability to run its business;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;whether the worker has made clear that the views expressed are personal, or whether they might be seen as representing the views of the employer, and whether that might present a reputational risk;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;whether there is a potential power imbalance given the nature of the worker’s position or role and that of those whose rights are intruded upon;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;the nature of the employer’s business, in particular where there is a potential impact on vulnerable service users or clients;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;whether the limitation imposed is the least intrusive measure open to the employer.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It has been found that philosophical belief can have just as much importance to a person’s life as a religious belief, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/employment-appeal-tribunal-decisions/the-general-municipal-and-boilermakers-union-v-mr-keith-henderson-ukeat-0073-14-dm&quot;&gt;General Municipal and Boilermakers Union v Henderson UKEAT/0073/14&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For conduct to constitute the manifestation of a protected belief, there must be a sufficiently close and direct nexus between the conduct and the underlying belief, though the conduct need not be a mandatory requirement of an established religion for it to qualify (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/fre#%7B%22itemid%22:%5B%22002-7391%22%5D%7D&quot;&gt;Eweida and others v UK&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:4&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The mistake made by the ET in Forstater was to fail to apply the proportionality test.  This led them to (wrongly) conclude that any manifestation of her belief could potentially constitute harassment for the purposes of s.26 of the Equality Act, meaning that there were no circumstances where she could refer to a person by their biological sex and not their preferred gender in all circumstances.  See Forstater para 103-104. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:6&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;See Wasteney v East London NHS Foundation [2016] 4 WLUK 120). &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:7&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-endnote&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For instance, in Mackereth the EAT found that the ET had wrongly assumed that a failure to use a service user’s chosen pronoun would in all cases give rise to unlawful discrimination or harassment. Once again it was reiterated: the expression of a protected belief does not in of itself constitute discrimination, victimisation or harassment, and does not of itself trigger justifiable limitations on the expression of that belief. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:8&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot; role=&quot;doc-backlink&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-07-19-why-is-seen-important-to-me-vii/">&lt;p&gt;Bring your whole self to work is what my employer tells me. Unless of course you happen to believe like I do that sex is binary and fixed from conception. In that case I am allowed to hold that belief (thank you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/forstater-v-cgd-europe-and-ors/&quot;&gt;Maya&lt;/a&gt;), but not to express it plainly in case it causes offense to those who believe that the concept of innate gender identity is more important in all cases than biological sex, or somehow denies their identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what about my identity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my employer asks for my gender but not my sex, or asks for my gender without giving me the option to say that I do not believe in an innate gender, this denies my identity. My sex is important to me. My sex has shaped my life. During my career I have experienced sexism, disadvantage and discrimination due to my sex and I have had to fight against the stereotypes imposed upon me due to my sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my employer asks me to state whether I identify as a woman, this denies my identity. To use woman in this way is to change it from a definition based on sex, to one based on gender identity. I am not a woman because I have womanly thoughts and feelings which are separate and distinct from manly thoughts and feelings - and if you think I am you need to reconsider as this is the very definition of sexism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my employer allows me to be referred to as cis-gendered, this denies my identity. I am not a woman because my personality happens to align with the stereotypical expectations that society places on me due to my sex, any more than I would not be a woman if my personality did not. And my personality, like that of everyone else I have ever met, is a mix of those traits that society ascribes to be feminine and masculine because stereotypes are nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a woman because my sex is female. But knowing my sex tells you nothing about me except what my sex is. It does not tell you about my personality, my likes and dislikes, my strengths and weaknesses. There is no trait, characteristic, thought or feeling that I share with all other women on this planet and which is distinct from those shared by men, other than our biology. So I say again, I am a woman because my sex is female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all afforded protections in law to prevent us from suffering from discrimination and harassment or to preserve our privacy and dignity because of our sex. But as it stands my employer has no record of my sex and has replaced sex with gender and that is why SEEN is so important to me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-01-25-why-is-seen-important-to-me-iii/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This post is the third of &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/launch-speeches/&quot;&gt;four speeches by SEEN members&lt;/a&gt; from our launch event in October.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-loss-of-the-word-woman&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Loss of the Word Woman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to speak about language – primarily the loss of the word ‘woman’ to describe an adult human female  - and its emotional impact on me. Language matters and the loss of our words hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen a quiet dismantling over the past few years across our public institutions (including the Civil Service) of sex-based language. By ‘quiet’ I mean that it’s happened without any consultation with the group it primarily impacts – women. It starts by replacing the word ‘sex’ (the material fact of being male or female) with the word ‘gender’ (the social roles and stereotypes associated with either sex) and ends with the word ‘woman’ being routinely separated from our female bodies or reproductive functions, and suddenly we find ourselves referred to as cervix-havers, menstruators, birthing parents, lactators, bodies with vaginas, pregnant people or ‘people experiencing the menopause’. These examples aren’t one-offs - they are now seen regularly in NHS information campaigns, women’s health charities, corporate advertising, Civil Service policies, networks and newsletters, and mainstream media news reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon isn’t restricted to the UK. Women’s Declaration International&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which reaffirms women and girls’ sex-based rights as set out in CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women) recognises that in relation to protecting women’s sex based rights including reproductive rights, protection from male violence against women, participation in sports and the need for single-sex spaces, we are unable to safeguard women’s rights effectively while at the same time, twisting our language to include men.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words ‘gender neutral’ and ‘inclusive’ might sound positive and well-intentioned and may be intended as a way to avoid hurting anyone’s feelings, but in considering the feelings of one group  - those who find sexed language problematic - we give real pain to another group.  When women say that erasing the words we use to describe ourselves and our reality is painful, (and we do say this) why are we not listened to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about my feelings.  When I see or hear any of these female body-part or reproductive function terms such as ‘pregnant people’ instead of ‘pregnant women’, or ‘anyone with a cervix aged 25-64 ’ instead of ‘women aged 25-64’ I experience distress and rage, my heart rate speeds up, my chest tightens, and I feel nauseous. I consciously calm myself before I decide whether to ignore it or to challenge with a &lt;em&gt;‘We are women. Call us women.’&lt;/em&gt; There’s a real emotional cost either way – ignore it and I lose self-respect and feel I lack courage; challenge it and I know I will either be ignored, or receive a dismissive &lt;em&gt;‘this organisation uses inclusive language’&lt;/em&gt; response, which implies it’s my reaction that’s out of kilter, or that my concern is not valid or that my views are fringe. Challenging in a public space can sometimes mean being called unkind, hateful, out-of-touch, or even fascist. Such accusations might be made out of a misguided desire to be kind and accommodating to others but they are often intended to ostracise, alienate and instil fear.  They prevent reasonable discourse and aim instead to silence, to shame and to control. And it works – I know many women who say nothing out of fear. And all this just for believing that adult females should be called women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does my anger at this language, which has surprised me by its strength, come from and why does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was brought up to be a feminist  by a single mother. She would say the personal is political. My emotion doesn’t come out of nowhere. I was a child in the 60s and 70s and learned from a young age that women have had to fight to achieve social and political equality with men, that our biological reproductive role, and vulnerability to male violence, mean that we sometimes require additional legal protections and safe spaces to achieve equality and that one of the reasons girls and women have struggled to achieve parity with men is that men control language. ‘Man’ in the Bible includes ‘Woman’ or does it? The ‘Rights of Man’ – to vote, to speak, to own property, to organise politically &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; include women but it often did not. Whether we were included or excluded was sometimes hard to discern and out of our control. Women were invisible, subsumed by the male default, and separately defined only in relation to men. Our names belonged to our fathers, then our husbands and our history became harder to trace. We began to understand this and for a few short decades that coincide with my life, we started to reclaim female language, history and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in a sudden reversal of progress, that I and many others did not foresee, the word ‘woman’ is routinely used to mean – not an adult human who is female, as understood by humanity for thousands of years and as defined in the Equality Act 2010 - but to mean anyone of either sex who says they’re a woman. So women as a separately defined sex class are, if not invisible, then blurred and ill-defined. This hurts because the words woman along with girl, mother, daughter and sister are precious. I remember the charity SANDS - which supports anyone affected by the death of a baby - putting out a communication on social media which did not use the word ‘mother’ once, instead saying ‘parent’ or ‘birthing parent’. This was done in the name of ‘inclusion’. The number of responses from bereaved women anguished at not being called ‘mothers’ was heart-breaking and led SANDS to back down and apologise to those women. Such ability to listen to the strength of this emotion and reflect seems sadly to be rare. Women now have to lobby and complain to each individual organisation, employer and charity just to persuade them to use the word ‘women’ and even then it usually falls on deaf ears which teaches us a lesson. It teaches us that the opinions and feelings of women matter very little to institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mothers and grandmothers achieved so much, and social and political parity appeared to be within sight by the 1980s. And now this. We are at risk of losing the language which describes our sex as based in material reality. If that happens, we will have no collective means to describe our female experience or to combat inequality. I despair when I hear the fight to retain abortion rights in the US framed as the ‘rights of people capable of becoming pregnant’. Imagine if the suffragettes had been hamstrung by language that was so inclusive that instead of “Votes For Women!” they’d felt obliged to say ‘Votes for people with a cervix!’  A battle cannot be won without clear and ringing language - ‘A Vindication of The Rights of Woman’!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We find ourselves now having to fight just to protect and define the word ‘woman’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are tempted to think that language has changed simply to reflect a more inclusive and equal society, ask yourself why you rarely, if ever, see men referred to either by the NHS or the Civil Service as ‘prostate owners’ or ‘sperm providers.’ They are just called men! Why? In one recent newsletter in my own civil service department  I saw that one staff event referred to &lt;em&gt;‘people going through the menopause’&lt;/em&gt;, and another event on the same page referred to &lt;em&gt;‘men’s mental health.’&lt;/em&gt; Particularly ironic when mental health issues are experienced by both men and women and the menopause exclusively by women. We are experiencing a new and insidious form of sexism and exclusion that comes disguised as inclusion and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see invisibility shrouding women one short generation after the battle for sex equality seemed to be all over bar the shouting. I say sex equality, never gender equality. I, like millions of women, have experienced girlhood, female puberty, womanhood, pregnancy, childbirth, motherhood, breastfeeding and menopause. These are all experiences exclusive to the female sex. I attended the traumatic and frightening birth of one grandson. My daughter and I knew what being a woman meant during that night and day. It is real. It is not an identity, a feeling or a costume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling women birthing parents, menstruators and ‘people going through the menopause’, is not only dehumanising and insulting but it has the catastrophic psychological effect of dividing women from each other. What does a menstruator have in common with a ‘person experiencing the menopause’ or with a 70-year-old cervix-haver or with a birthing parent? Unless we can say without any qualification that ‘of course they are all women’, the effect is that they have nothing in common other than their humanity which we share with boys and men, and we have broken the cherished link that all girls and women, young and old, mothers or childless, and with or without various reproductive experiences, have in common with each other as we pass from childhood to old age and which we do not share with any boy or man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want SEEN to be a place in the Civil Service where women can say all of this without fear of censure and to remind every HR department and policy maker to think carefully about whether reducing women and girls to a multiplicity of body parts and functions is kind or inclusive at all.&lt;/p&gt;
