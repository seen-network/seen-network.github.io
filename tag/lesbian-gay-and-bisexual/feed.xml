      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-10-18-lets-talk-about-pronouns/">&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of Monday, 9th October we approached everyone on our mailing list to ask them what they thought about practices related to the statement of pronouns in email signatures and elsewhere.  One thing was immediately clear: this was something many had been burning to talk about!  Within 3 hours we’d had close to 50 responses, and from there they continued coming in steadily until we received our 100th contribution on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had such a brilliant selection of answers, we’d like to share some of them in full, alongside a general summary and some overall themes. None of the comments included are from the SEEN Steering Group (we’ll follow up with some of our opinions at a later date).  We’ve attributed contributors in the way they’ve asked us to (be that first names, initials or just anonymous). Not all of them reflect views held within SEEN’s steering group, but we wanted to publish a varied selection to promote debate and showcase the diverse perspectives on this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;impartiality-and-the-cs-code&quot;&gt;Impartiality and the CS Code&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over three quarters of respondents highlighted what they see as the political nature of pronoun declaration and the associated ideology underpinning it (that is, belief in gender identity), with the view that this was not considered appropriate in an impartial Civil Service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of these comments include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘It does often feel like we have to show support regardless of if we agree with the cause and in an impartial Civil Service I don’t think that’s right’ – Anonymous, Home Office&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘We don’t indicate our affiliation with other ideological beliefs on official emails, e.g. which political or religious ideology we support. It is unnecessary for us to do our jobs and shouldn’t be encouraged as we are public servants who should strive to be as impartial as possible on all matters.’ – Anonymous, DSTL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘As civil servants we are expected to remain politically impartial, a simple rule to which I am careful to adhere. Plastering your beliefs on every email sent out does not imply a political impartiality, quite the opposite.’ – Anonymous, APHA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Senior managers should be aware of the pressure that this display of partisan support for one side of this highly political issue places on other staff members to avoid expressing non-conforming views.  Senior Civil Servants (in particular) should be scrupulously neutral, and pronoun declarations are anything but.’ – Emma, HMRC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I see no reason why I should advertise where I stand on an issue which is going to be a political hot potato in the run up to the next election.’ – Gill, MOJ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These highlight that the adding of pronouns is considered by many to be far from a neutral step, especially when adopted by senior management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sexism-womens-rights-and-sex-stereotypes&quot;&gt;Sexism, women’s rights and sex stereotypes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of our members see stating pronouns as a clear indicator of a belief in gender identity (and that this should always take precedence over sex).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a third of respondents highlighted how they believed the pushing / attempted enforcement of gender identity beliefs was having a detrimental effect on the rights of women in the workplace. Notably, a number of women in STEM from the MOD highlighted this, including Liz and Clare. Liz said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘As a female in engineering, I am normally in the minority.  Although overt sexism within engineering is no way near as bad as it once was, use of pronouns highlights that I’m not in the ‘boys club’ as even now there is a general belief that engineering is not for women.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clare had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I have experienced a lot of sexism throughout my career in IT and seriously considered going by my gender-neutral middle name before joining the civil service. I decided not to, but I still consider that reinforcing that someone is female exposes them to implicit bias and potential disadvantage. I also think that declaring pronouns is like declaring your star sign, if there was a climate where expressing a lack of belief in horoscopes could lead to a person being disciplined or even fired from their jobs. It’s reliant on a belief and therefore very divisive and because it’s known that some people feel so passionately about it, it’s a reminder that those people could hate you or harbour a grudge against you.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many who highlighted this angle also expressed their concerns about how encouraging the use of pronouns (and thus implying belief in gender identity) was distressing, as it implied a &lt;em&gt;‘right’&lt;/em&gt; way to be a man or a woman, tied to stereotypes of femininity/masculinity, such as &lt;em&gt;‘FF, MoJ’&lt;/em&gt; who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘It promotes an ideology that if you are female who does not [reflect] social roles and stereotypes of femininity you are not a woman, [and] similarly if you are a man who rejects the social roles of masculinity then you are not a man.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;homophobialgbt-concerns&quot;&gt;Homophobia/LGBT concerns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of gay and lesbian members also wrote to express that, in addition to sexism, they believed the practice was also a signpost for homophobia, such as &lt;em&gt;‘Anonymous, DWP’&lt;/em&gt; who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Lesbians are being banned from creating lesbian only events. As a gay man, listing my pronouns would feel like publicly supporting an ideology that seeks to erase gays and lesbians.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several members also expressed their concerns for those who have gender dysphoria or are struggling with issues around identity, and how the enforcement of this practice may make them uncomfortable, such as &lt;em&gt;‘Anonymous from DEFRA’&lt;/em&gt; who said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I worry that encouraging people to add pronouns to emails or provide them in introductions places undue pressure on those who are still working through issues of gender dysphoria. It’s not work’s place to ‘out’ people in this way.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others highlighted that while the practice of pronoun declaration made them uncomfortable, they still had great sympathy for those struggling with gender dysphoria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;autism-and-neurodiversity&quot;&gt;Autism and neurodiversity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of respondents also highlighted how people with autism or other neurodiverse conditions can struggle with preferred pronouns that do not match a person’s clearly observed sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Anonymous from Scottish Government’&lt;/em&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I have always used pronouns in line with my presumption of someone’s sex except where it is clear they wish me to do something different. In that case I tend to default to using their first name repeatedly as using their preferred pronouns makes me feel complicit in a lie which is probably more awkward for me as my autism makes me very reluctant to dissemble.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;‘Kate from DEFRA’&lt;/em&gt; commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I also really feel for people with neurodivergence such as autism, I know a lot of folk are worried that they will accidentally misgender someone and with CS buying into the Stonewall narrative that accidentally ‘misgendering’ someone is transphobic I worry that the pronoun pushing will get these folks in trouble and potentially on a disciplinary.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-culture-of-fear&quot;&gt;A culture of fear&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many members highlighted the culture of fear that is created around pronoun declaration and associated beliefs about gender identity. Some described having faced direct discrimination and harassment from colleagues for refusing to participate in pronoun declarations to the extent that they are now scared or concerned when they interact with someone who has pronouns in their signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘AG from UK Export Finance’&lt;/em&gt; commented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘it shouldn’t be done… Additionally, the threats when pronouns aren’t included or added by those that want them to be is horrific.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘NM from DEFRA’&lt;/em&gt; was one of the many people who expressed the view that it led to exclusion, rather than inclusion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I feel the use of pronouns in the workplace is unnecessary and alienating to many people. It does not create an inclusive culture, but instead a culture of fear and isolation’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of links to external blogs that appeared to push the practice was something also raised by many, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/gender-pronouns-in-workplace&quot;&gt;this blog from Culture Amp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other SEEN members have queried why blogs like the above are allowed, whereas &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filia.org.uk/latest-news/2021/12/1/should-you-declare-your-pronouns-a-simple-guide&quot;&gt;blogs like this&lt;/a&gt; aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;support-for-preferred-pronouns&quot;&gt;Support for preferred pronouns&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the overwhelming response from those who disagreed with the declaration of pronouns, we also received a handful of responses which said they didn’t mind pronouns in other people’s signatures, as long as they weren’t expected to declare pronouns themselves, and as long as they could still accurately describe someone’s sex in situations where relevant.  We also received four contributions strongly in favour of use of pronouns in signatures and work profiles, if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEEN welcomes a plurality of views and opinions, and we also look to seek tolerance and understanding between those with differing views.  For these reasons, we have also  included two perspectives in favour of pronouns below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Will from MoJ’&lt;/em&gt; had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Another potential benefit of having everyone record their pronouns on their profile is that should someone feel the need to challenge whether someone was using the ‘correct’ facilities in the workplace because they were spending too much time in them themselves to mind their own business and return to work, they would be able to confirm how they identify against their profile (if they knew who the individual was) and avoid making a mistake in thinking someone was in a space they shouldn’t have been. If someone was to then bring an issue like this up to management etc to ‘deal with’ they would be able to challenge back about what they themselves were doing in the facilities for so long to be able to notice when they should only be in those facilities to do their business and then return to work, ensuring everyone is protected from those who loiter in the facilities and report them to the police if necessary.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘John (they/them) from MoJ’&lt;/em&gt; said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘I am non-binary and I include my pronouns in my email signature and it is also configured to appear in Teams via an option in my Global Address List Entry. It allows colleagues to correctly gender me in meetings without me having to state my pronouns regularly or correct them if they initially assume I use different pronouns. This makes me feel much more included, less stressed, and less awkward.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many will have sympathy for John and will choose to add pronouns for the purpose of kindness.  However,  &lt;em&gt;‘Anonymous, DESNZ’&lt;/em&gt; has a different view of the result of such intentions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;My line manager, a pleasant bloke with young children, has ‘pronouns he/him’ after his name on his email signature. Next to it, he has carefully made a hyperlink marked ‘Why do I do this?’, which links to a political blog about ‘allyship’. Whenever an email from him pops up, there also pops up the ‘pronouns he/him’. And every time his name and pronouns pop up on my screen, I get a lurch of dread in my stomach and fight back tears. My lovely, fragile young niece comes into my mind again, I feel helpless, and I can’t concentrate on my work. My teenaged, soon-to-be-adult niece, who has for years struggled with depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We all helped and supported her as best as we could and hoped maturity and time would work its magic and foster her growing into the strong, healthy young woman we know she can be, just like a million awkward teenagers before her have grown up and worked it out.  Instead, she got caught up in the gender identity movement and is trapped in an alternate universe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Now she feels ‘special’ and ‘chosen’, rather than just an awkward ugly duckling who got teased by the cool kids. Now she is praised for her ‘bravery’ by the cool kids at her new 6th Form and they tell her the rest of the world is against her and only her ‘allies’ will defend her.   […]&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We try still to hold her as close as we can and tell her we love her just the way she is, and that she doesn’t need to pretend to be a boy for the world to accept her. We hope we can keep hold of her before she is old enough to buy cross-sex hormones or get on a surgery waiting list to have her breasts chopped off. She threatens both on her darkest days, full of weeping and panic attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Does my line manager know about girls like my niece? Every day, I think, I must talk to him. But what can I say, when our workplace policies allow and encourage ‘pronouns’? He has also been praised as ‘brave’, for being ‘a good ally to vulnerable people’. Does he know how this violent political movement of gender identity, that he so casually promotes with his ‘pronouns’, damages vulnerable girls like my niece? If he doesn’t know, why doesn’t he bother to find out? If he does know, how can he be so callous?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank you all for your honesty and engagement in this issue.  Watch out for Part 2 (coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="/posts/2023-09-17-why-is-seen-important-to-me-viii/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why SEEN is important to me (viii)" />
      <published>2023-09-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2023-09-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-09-17-why-is-seen-important-to-me-viii/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Celebrate Bisexuality Week, we wanted to share this post from a civil servant. This post shares an individual’s personal experience, which includes frank references to his negative experiences in another civil service network.  Many staff networks will have members and interests in common, but we also serve differing needs and as this post makes clear, these are sometimes incompatible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We hope that sharing these experiences will allow a better understanding of this, and this in turn will help act as a first step to allow us to work together to reach a place where all staff networks can complement and support one another.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our network, as ever, welcomes collaborative dialogue between networks and across government departments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;︵‿︵‿︵‿︵‿︵&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share some thoughts on why, as a bisexual man, SEEN is important to me, and why I haven’t found a home in the existing LGBT+ networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The popular cliché is that a bisexual is some young, frivolous person with blue, green or purple hair and probably various facial and other piercings and a devil-may-care attitude to societal norms and who believes that gender is fluid.  But it also includes people like me, a 50 something ex-policeman, in the Civil Service, divorced with kids and who is attracted to both sexes: appreciating the masculinity in men and the femininity in women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early on I accepted that my bisexuality was purely one manifestation of the continuum of human sexuality and I was relatively content in that knowledge. In spite of my own acceptance, I have always wanted to protect those around me from the knowledge or, where I had told them, at least the stigma of being the parent, sibling, wife, child or friend of someone who is bisexual. I believed this was the least I could do to show my gratitude and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, I had become very isolated and alone, in part because I had moved around quite a lot geographically, but also because I lacked contact with people with whom I could be myself, and who shared some of my life experiences. I knew intuitively that there were others in a similar predicament, but I didn’t know where I could find them. I had read that bisexuals are at risk of poor mental health and I did feel that I was suffering, so I looked first to the LGBT network for support, and in particular the Bi+ Inclusion Group. It wasn’t something that came easy to me and I was sceptical about whether I would fit in. However, I had hoped to find a friendly welcoming group where I could discuss my feelings and find other bisexual people with similar life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people on the calls were friendly enough and we all conducted ourselves respectfully, but unfortunately it was apparent that the “+” was more important than the “bi” in the title of the group, even though often the “+” was omitted, as if it were a given that we all accept that there are many genders rather than two sexes. Stonewall came up in conversation once and I questioned why there seemed to be such an obsession with the view of one organisation, when there were other organisations such as the LGB Alliance with differing views. I was told that the LGB Alliance was a fascist and anti-trans organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, after several months of attending I was approached privately and it was made clear that having gender critical views was not welcome. It felt like the ultimate bi erasure as a bi man not being welcome in a Bi(+) group. However, looking back at my experience of the group I recognised that I had never found what I wanted there; a place to relax and speak openly. It seemed that rather than being allowed to speak about our own feelings and experiences, we were required to submit to a political ideology whether or not we agreed with it. There were also very few men who regularly dialled into the calls, so again it was difficult to find people with a similar life experience to my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having gone back into my shell somewhat, it was a revelation to later happen across SEEN where different perspectives are tolerated, diverse voices welcome and same sex attraction is recognised as a unique category of experience.  I hope others will also find a welcome here too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>/posts/rural-lesbians-and-a-safer-world</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-06-29-rural-lesbians-and-a-safer-world/">&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the rural idyll of Herefordshire &amp;amp; Worcestershire, having known most of my life that I was attracted to my own sex. There was little chance of my ever “coming out”, even though I went to an all-girls school, because at that time there was still huge stigma attached to being lesbian. It would have been social death at school, and I really didn’t want to cope with being ostracised while trying to complete my O-levels. The successful gaining of O-levels was directly linked to my gaining a motorbike and I wanted that nearly as much as I wanted a set of drums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer pressure and hormones encouraged me to have boyfriends and although I knew it wasn’t for me, I persevered in the hope Mr Right might rock up. He almost did, but when I met the woman of my dreams all that faded into dust. She was an old school friend who’d moved to the USA and done her coming out while playing in a rock band. I had all the savvy of vegetarianism and an interest in surviving the nuclear threat, so she was impossibly cool and desirable in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went out to Birmingham, to find signs of life. It was an eye opener for me but ennui for her. After a brief but intense fling where I finally gained escape velocity from heterosexuality, she went back to America and I went off to the feminist peace protest at Greenham Common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I now needed a girlfriend to cement my fledgling lesbian status and fortunately one appeared. We had very similar backgrounds and interests, and we were both seeking our first female partner. I struggled to find my feet in this new world and my parents’ aspirations for me evaporated. After some tense battles - &lt;em&gt;“It’s like you’re going through puberty again!”&lt;/em&gt; - I was kicked out and this is how I ended up in a 25 year relationship complete with cats and eventually a civil partnership. With hindsight, I should have slowed down, but the miniscule size of my lesbian dating pool added pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only there’d been somewhere to go for advice and support… At the time there was London Gay Switchboard, or Lesbian Line (one night a week). It was impossible to get through on either number. And what could they have advised me, anyway? Go to the big city like Jimmy Somerville? Move to Greenham and hope for the best?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the late 1980s, the HIV/AIDS crisis had arrived and was changing the complexion of gay life forever. Bizarrely, it was this situation that pushed many of us into action. With my gay male friends, we women had been talking about setting something up to help our community, and we decided we needed our own lifeline. Hereford &amp;amp; Worcester Lesbian &amp;amp; Gay Switchboard was born. As is often the case, we had more men than women in the group, but we did our best to train ourselves and learn to handle calls of all kinds and from either sex. I absolutely know what a vertical learning curve feels like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set up a monthly fundraiser at a local nightclub, and swiftly gained support from the local sexual health team who were desperate to promote safer sex. This was the battleground era of Section 28 (a law which that prohibited the “promotion of homosexuality” by local authorities) and AIDS scaremongering, so looking back I realise quite how brave and determined we were. The head of the county education authority wanted our Switchboard’s service office closed down because we were in a building with many other charities and there were “vulnerable young people in wheelchairs”. The venom and gross prejudice was palpable but we held our ground and triumphed over adversity for over ten years. Our mission for the Switchboard was that we would not need to exist: we hoped the world would catch up and become a more welcoming place for us. When the calls slowed to a trickle, we knew things had changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We organised the first gathering of UK lesbian and gay switchboards over a weekend in Worcester and even the mighty London Switchboard turned up! A mix of rural and urban organisations were represented. I delivered a presentation on sexual health and safer sex for lesbians, which at the time was either overlooked or subject to bad advice. For example, lesbians were told we didn’t need to take tests for cervical cancer. I made the plea for better understanding of lesbian health needs as well as those of our gay brothers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those years hold bittersweet memories of struggle, insight, joy, fellowship and loss. They helped form the person I am today and drive me to want that perspective in my working life. SEEN offers the chance for us to recreate the best of that shared history for lesbians and gay men in the civil service, and I look forward to welcoming colleagues as we grow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="/posts/2023-04-26-lesbian-visibility-day/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Celebrating Lesbian Visibility Day 2023" />
      <published>2023-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2023-04-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/posts/lesbian-visibility-day</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-04-26-lesbian-visibility-day/">&lt;p&gt;Lesbians in history have tended to be largely invisible (try naming five famous lesbians… or try naming five famous lesbians without mentioning Martina). Despite a heyday in the 1990s, we are once again disappearing - hence Lesbian Visibility Day.  Let’s prepare for our day of celebration and visibility by looking at a selection of historical highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesbian mythology includes gems like this: Ministers bringing legislation outlawing homosexuality to Queen Victoria for royal assent were too nervous to explain the intent to include women. Some say Victoria was told, but reacted with such disbelief that ladies would behave that way, that only men were outlawed! So in recent history, lesbians remained legally undescribed. This was handy if you didn’t want to be imprisoned, but unhelpful in terms of being understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patriarchy was largely unbothered by lesbianism, unless there was any threat to male superiority. But there were economic reasons why women struggled to live independently from men. Love whom you like, so long as you can afford it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women living apart from men have always been treated with suspicion and had fewer life choices, for both economic and social reasons: wife, witch or nun, basically. Whether the concept of lesbianism as we know it today would have been understood prior to the 20th century is debatable, but it’s likely there have always been women desperate to avoid “traditional” gender roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most famous lesbian, Sappho, lived on the Greek island of Lesbos around 630- 570 BC. This is how here we get the term “lesbian”. Sappho was a revered lyric poet, but most of her works are lost so we rely only on remaining fragments. Sappho was possibly the Melissa Etheridge of her day, writing songs that told of love between women - but like the C90 cassette compilation of my favourite songs, they are lost to us now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arabian writings about lesbianism from the medieval era include perhaps the first (written) lesbian love story, in a 10th century treatise called “The Encyclopaedia of Pleasure”. The Medieval Europeans were far more draconian in their views on homosexuality, with severe punishment (including torturous death) for men and banishment for women. By the time of the Spanish Inquisition, only the pure escaped punishment. Lesbians were therefore overly represented amongst witches and in female-only institutions like convents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later famous lesbians include the Ladies of Llangollen and Anne Lister. Thanks to her diaries and the recent successful TV drama, the legendary Anne Lister is well known for her love of the “fairer sex”, as well as the financial independence which enabled her to indulge it. She visited the Ladies in Llangollen, which begs the question of how they organised this in days of very slow media. I live in the super-speedy online world of the 21st century and it’s like herding cats getting a group of lesbians together in the same space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Salon culture of Paris and other European cities during the early 20th century was tailored to the rich, famous, or rising stars, but also provided previously unavailable social opportunities for lesbians. The Second World War provided untold chances for lesbians, as women worked beyond the home. Lesbian culture developed a strong underground vibe, hidden away from salacious eyes. Watch the film “The Killing of Sister George”, revealing the (literally underground) Gateways club in the 1960s. There were similar hideaways still available in 1980s Brighton!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treatment for male homosexuality largely depended on class/ money, but there is little research or data regarding lesbians. Many lesbians ended up in mental hospitals, and some of them never left. Attempts to “cure” homosexuality are notoriously unsuccessful and mercifully some psychiatrists realised this. A lesbian treated by a female psychiatrist at the Tavistock clinic following a suicide attempt was told: “You must remember it is natural for you… People who are left-handed and who are forced to write with their right hand usually develop a stutter…and you are sexually left handed” (Sarah Carr &amp;amp; Helen Spandler, The Lancet April 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USA’s influential Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders listed homosexuality as a mental disorder from 1968 until 1973, when it became a “sexual orientation disturbance”. But homosexuality only left the publication in 1987 – two years after I “came out” as lesbian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Lesbian” is falling out of fashion for some, in favour words like “queer” or “gay”, or sometimes replaced with the terms “bisexual” or “pansexual”. Theories for this suggest the word lesbian is considered to be old-fashioned or embarrassing.  However, many of us remain happy and proud to call ourselves lesbians, as it is a distinctive and defining word for us as female homosexuals, separate from men’s words. Interestingly, male homosexuals are far less likely to have their terminology and culture challenged!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that women and girls throughout history (and still today in some parts of the world) have disguised themselves as males to get work, be educated, travel alone, escape marriage, or simply to try to keep safe from sexual attack. Some women will have done this to be free to have relationships with other women, but it’s hard to be sure because clear evidence like Anne Lister’s diaries is scarce. Women have always pursued close relationships with each other and lived together for many reasons, which won’t always have been romantic or sexual. Women’s solidarity and closeness is an historical constant, whether we are lesbian or not, and we should celebrate whatever form that takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do meet a lesbian in the wild today, rejoice, for we are in small numbers and often camouflaged, except that one day of the year when we celebrate…&lt;/p&gt;

      <id>/posts/why-is-seen-important-to-me-v</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-03-27-why-is-seen-important-to-me-v/">&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t something I ever saw myself doing, after I came out as a lesbian to my family that loved and accepted me, to walking with Stonewall at London’s Pride Parade. I didn’t know that a new ideology was emerging from internet discussions into general life and into politics. I didn’t see myself as a very political person until I realised what you can lose if you don’t pay attention to the discussions around you. This is why I’m no longer afraid to speak, because I’m now aware of what there is to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life as a lesbian is determined by my sex and the sex of the person I fall in love with. This same-sex attraction is what gays and lesbians have fought to protect in this country, and in countries where my grandparents were born – is still illegal and could get me killed. My elderly, Jamaican grandparents who live in the UK have amazingly accepted me with love—even more challenging for them than me telling them that I was an atheist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I feel now, in communities expressly for people like me, is a poison of distrust and hate for reasons that are far from reasonable. Apparently now it’s true that my earlier definition of homosexuality is now a statement of hate and a ‘dogwhistle’. It seems like without any balanced discussion, we have now accepted the ideology of gender identity, something I see as similar to adopting the Christian faith of my grandparents without question, because they would feel distress if I didn’t?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender identity in the workplace forces me to lie, and I like to think that I’m an honest and open person.  Gender identity makes me worry for the boundaries of private spaces such as toilets. Sometimes I go into work sweaty and need to change clothes, and rather than use the small cubicles I quickly switch tops near the sinks. Gender identity puts an extra stress on a lone female, unsure if the toilets will truly be single-sex, and if a male person states his right to use our spaces, we will further worry about what may happen if we show anything but blind faith in the male’s personal belief that he is the same as us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am respectful with my own beliefs, but I do not use religious epithets when talking to a Sunni Muslim colleague, nor pray with my Christian colleague over her lunch. When I tell them I am an atheist I’m not called slurs, but when women say we do not believe in gender ideology we are called “terfs”, bigots and casual violence is promised by either a punch or murder by those of particular strong faith (protest signs in Scotland come to mind). This toxic environment makes one wary of speaking out, which is why I really do think you will not hear many voices like mine, because they are silenced out of fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really do love my job, I can see the many great ways my career can progress as I learn more. In the end we are trying to be apolitical in our approach to our work with shared goals.  Why would we jeopardise that by forcing people to lie and pretend that biological sex doesn’t matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding SEEN was like a breath of fresh air. It was exactly what was needed; clear information and a perspective to balance out the poisonous atmosphere. They put sex above gender identity and highlight the reality of living in a sexed world by sharing information on female safety and sexist stereotypes or behaviours. I’m also pleased to see them shine a light on forgotten LGB history this February, especially when important figures are set aside or written over to declare their faith to gender ideology. Here I think of a gay man, Malcolm Michaels Jr, known famously as Marsha P Johnson who was an outspoken gay rights activist.  According to Stonewall veteran Fred Sergeant, he was proud of being a non-confirming gay man, and although he had a drag queen act, did not identify as a trans woman, a label that has only been attributed to him by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEEN knows this, and as we learn how to engage with each other’s networks respectfully I feel so much more hopeful about the future of the workplace environment. I hope more voices are heard within the Civil Service, and due to the clear divide of politics within LGBT spaces, it is crucial that talks continue.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-03-12-detrans-awareness-day/">&lt;p&gt;‘Detransitioners’ are people who have taken social or medical steps to change their gender but who later decide they feel more comfortable with their birth sex. Detransitioners are diverse and have varied and complex histories to tell, and we must respect how each one tells their own story and how they would like to be supported, including at work. We are platforming one SEEN member today to tell his own story today, to mark Detransition Awareness Day 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about detransition and detransitioners’ stories, here are some resources:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://genspect.org/&quot;&gt;genspect.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://post-trans.com/&quot;&gt;post-trans.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.detransawareness.org/&quot;&gt;detransawareness.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-chat-with-ritchie-herron&quot;&gt;A chat with Ritchie Herron&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Detrans awareness day this year, SEEN Steering Group member Jimmy spoke to one of our SEEN members, Ritchie Herron, about transitioning and detransitioning and how this affected him in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NB: Ritchie has asked us to flag up a trigger warning on this article for colleagues, specifically transgender colleagues, that may find discussion of ‘detransition’ upsetting. Ritchie has advised that the last thing he wants to do is to upset or hurt anyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; For Detrans Awareness Day this year (12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; March) one of our members wanted to talk about his lived experience as a Civil Servant and how his transition and subsequent detransition affected his working life. His name is Ritchie Herron. Ritchie, can you tell us briefly about your history with the Civil Service?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, thanks for having me along to share my story. I started in the Civil Service in 2006 a few months after my 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. I was fresh faced and just out of college! I began working in a contact centre, an AO role. I was in that role for a long time, 14 years! I got a promotion to EO in 2020 and moved to HR in a business support role, then last year – April 2022 – I got a promotion to HEO, to my current role in potential risks posed by new and emerging technologies. I’m already looking at and working towards my next promotion, I’m really driven now and just going for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; So working for the Civil Service for almost 20 years, has it overall been a positive experience for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; My department has been an extremely supportive employer in a number of areas. Funnily enough, just today I was diagnosed with autism, which is something I suspected I had for a long time. I started enquiring about getting an assessment around 2019 I think, but due to lockdown this was significantly delayed. But I think since I started, the managers I’ve had and the staff I’ve worked with, even though they didn’t know I was autistic – and neither did I – they’ve always been incredibly sympathetic and understanding with regards to my clear social awkwardness in certain situations, and known it's not just because I’ve been deliberately difficult! I mean seriously – sometimes I would have absolutely no boundaries in work and would just say exactly what was on my mind! I wouldn’t be rude but, I remember one time talking to a customer and he said ‘Oh I’ve been married for 21 years,’ and I said ‘Really? Do you regret being married for 21 years?’ No filter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then after a while my mental health started really deteriorating and I started having meltdowns in work, and these meltdowns started to get more and more frequent. I had a really good manager though who was very understanding, even though dealing with me could be difficult. And then I transitioned…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed my name from Richard to Abby, initially just a social transition but then aged about 26 I started medical transition – oestrogen and so on. I’m not going to lie – I was an absolute chaotic mess for about 4 years. My behaviour at work got worse, as all the previous issues and awkward social situations I had I now blamed on ‘transphobia’. Seriously – if anyone disagreed with me at work or tried to address my poor behaviours I argued that they were being transphobic. In my defence though I was going through a lot – I had a lot of medical appointments to do with my transition. My direct managers didn’t know how to manage me but their senior manager was really good and used to ask me serious probing questions like ‘do you think you’ve not got a lot of control in your personal life, but you do here, and so that’s leading you to act out at work’, but he used to say it a very measured and sensitive way, so he was really good with me… and then I went through the full medical transition including surgery, and so I had a lot of time off both for the surgery and the after-care… but I realise now a lot of the issues I were going through were actually linked to other things – general poor mental health, OCD, and as I now know – autism. But when I was going through the treatment it gave me a feeling of belonging, that this is the right answer for me for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was calmer in work, I wasn’t kicking off all the time anymore. Because of the severity of the surgery and the medication it just… dulled everything. I had no energy. I wasn’t argumentative because I just had no energy. People would say to me ‘you seem so much better’ but I wasn’t, I just seemed that way because I couldn’t act out like I did before because my body had been through so much, been so heavily taxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; So you’d been in the Civil Service about… 6 or so years before you started to medically transition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; Medically transition, I think 8 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; 8 years… so without putting words into your mouth, it seems like when you did transition at least you felt on the whole that your senior management were supportive, even though you were going through a lot?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; That was later down the line. Initially nobody knew what to do with me. Then they brought in… I’ll just say a staff network that operates across government. They brought in this staff network to consult with on how to handle me, and to be honest this network just told my seniors that I can pretty much do what I want (!). And don’t get me wrong – there was a good policy around transgender staff but… in practice where I worked, HR had no actual experience of implementing this, but also there were aspects of the policy I didn’t want to follow. So I do feel like I’d put them in a difficult position because I’d put them in a brand new position they’d never been in before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; So no-one in your area had ever transitioned at work before? Is that what you mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; No, that’s not it – the reason is I effectively went against the established policy – as I said above. So at this time the local policy was that if you wanted to transition, you privately spoke to your management and HR. Then what you’d do is stage a fake resignation – just tell your colleagues you are quitting. Then you’d be moved to a new area, which you’d start under your new name and new identity, effectively so as to not ‘out’ you as transgender to your colleagues. But I refused to do that, I decided what I wanted to do and I just told everyone – all my colleagues, and I didn’t want to transfer somewhere else I wanted to stay where I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; So they had a process in place to protect the privacy of staff who were transitioning… but you just preferred to be out there, publicly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I didn’t want to be secretive, at the time I felt I was living my true self and I wanted to be proud of that, to my colleagues and friends in work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; I would be interested to know, from your perspective, as I appreciate that there are staff and throughout the wider Civil Service, who will transition and will be happy with their transition and consider it has been the best option to live their life to the fullest. So with that in mind I’d be interested in how your experience in work went when you were identifying as transgender. Was it difficult for you? Do you think you experienced genuine harassment or discrimination from your colleagues?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; My immediate colleagues on the whole were great, but you know how it is. There was a lot of hearsay and gossip at first when I transitioned. But also… At first I didn’t really know how to dress or style myself. I had short hair and stubble… I didn’t look like a woman at all! And that drew a lot of attention to the point where people would literally come to – to what I would call a floorplate safari to come and see me! So they’d pretend they had a reason to be there, and they’d usually come in twos or threes, with a tour guide who would point me out, and they’d walk past, get slower and just clearly stop and stare at me. And on the rare occasions when I’d have to go to other floors or areas, I’d see people pointing and laughing at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine at the time told me I was just being paranoid, but we were walking together somewhere in work one time, and there was this lass around my age, stood there looking really disgusted and just looking at me, and she called over a colleague and just started aggressively pointing and gesturing towards me. And then my friend just said ‘Jesus, I’m so sorry for telling you that you were just being paranoid’. So it was quite bad at the beginning. But then I found this group, this staff network I mentioned before – and they empowered me, but in a really bad way. And that’s when I started saying everything was transphobic, even when it clearly wasn’t. So because of that it made people really reserved and scared around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; So even though you may have been given bad advice or encouraged in a bad way by this group, it actually seems that outside of your immediate team it wasn’t a very friendly or welcoming environment for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; It wasn’t, no. I did get quite stressed out by some of the things that were going on and how I was being treated and stared at. I had a lot of medical appointments at this time, which was great, as I could use them then as an escape. I just wanted to be out of there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; What’s really interesting to me here when you talk about your journey, is that at first you said you wanted to stay where you were and be proud and happy, but then… it seems like that changed and you weren’t happy in work anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah… being happy and proud didn’t last very long to be honest. I think I was quite naïve. And then – it was actually lockdown when I felt I flourished in work! My progression has all happened since lockdown – 2 promotions! And I think that was due to being outside of the work environment. Being at home it was much easier for me to focus and actually just get on with work. I thrived away from the office – absolutely thrived, and I know a lot of people found lockdown really difficult, but for me it was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yeah at the start – especially the first year and a half, I actually found work diabolically difficult. Just for some additional background, I actually was a really late bloomer – I don’t think puberty really hit in for me until I was about 17, and I honestly feel like when I started on the anti-androgen treatment I was still developing. So then after that first year and a half or so at least then… my body hair had stopped growing and then I started learning how to dress more 'like a woman', I grew my hair out. And I think my face is quite androgynous anyway, like if you didn’t know as long as I dress and present the right way you could easily believe I was female. So effectively I’m saying I started to ‘pass’. So after 2 years or so of treatment, I could see an old colleague in work and they wouldn’t recognise me, and I also had voice coaching so I could ‘do the voice’ too, and I’d be like ‘Oh hi Paddy, how are you today’ and they’d be like ‘who the f*** are you!?’… oh sorry you probably can’t put that in! So what I’m saying is eventually I was able to blend in. But then, people would come and see me for another reason, I’d be out of control, when I’d got through the initial phase and was in the ‘everything is transphobic’ stage I’d be back to kicking off, I’d be really explosive, and people would come see me to see me explode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; What I’d like to ask you now Ritchie, since we’re talking to you specifically for Detrans Awareness Day, is at what point you decided that transition was not right for you, and you wanted to detransition. Actually, before you answer that – you mentioned earlier it was when working from home during lockdown that you really started to flourish, was it during this period that you realised you wanted to detransition?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; It was, but at that point, I was already disconnected from the trans community, because at this point I had become what they call a ‘trans-medicalist’, which is when you think someone is only trans when they medically transition – take hormones and so-on, which is funny in a way as years earlier one of the arguments I’d had with the cross government staff network I was involved in was that I wanted to support non-binary staff, but at that time they didn’t want to do that. Oh, by the way, I actually want it on record that I was removed from that network when I detransitioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was getting on well, working from home, then in March 2021, someone in work put up a post about Detrans Awareness Day. It was actually a gay man who did this. But I kicked off, massively, I said this is hate speech – I complained about him, I got the union involved. I didn’t actually read about what Detrans Awareness Day was or what it was about – I just saw the words and thought this has to be some antagonistic move to hurt trans people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even though I was doing and saying this, I already had doubts about my transition, mainly fuelled by the surgery and its aftereffects. I mean – I had major surgery in 2018. You can probably guess what the surgery was, without me going into graphic details. And I mean I had doubts, not just because of the issues and health problems I had directly as a result of the surgery. I started to realise that a lot of the issues I had that led me to transition were actually down to other factors – OCD, spending too much time in online communities, bullying, and what I suspected was autism. There were a lot of issues that made transition seem like an appealing option to me, and I realised this too late. So I’d seen that Detrans Awareness Day post, and I was very very reactive, but then about 6 months later I just thought, I need to look into this properly. I’m going to disprove all this ‘TERFy’ nonsense, and I can do this because I’m smart… because I’m the smartest trans person alive (laughs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started reading up on Detrans Awareness Day and detransitioners in general. And you know that South Park meme that’s based on the ‘aaand it’s gone’ and it says ‘I’m gonna read into this 'TERF' stuff… aaand I’m one of them’. Literally – that was me! I was reading all these stories from detransitioners and I realised – there was some deep truth in this. I started reading up a lot on the male side – on the stories of male detransitioners. I started reading stories of people around my age, who have similar thoughts and feelings, and it really resonated with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in late 2021 I thought I need to do more than just read other people’s stories, I need to talk to people that have been through this. I couldn’t talk about these feelings in trans spaces, because the other trans people would get very defensive, but it meant it felt like there was no one I could talk to, no one, until I found the Detrans Community. Talking to them made me realise there was another option. I’d thought before that to be a man you had to be a manly man and that wasn’t me, I’m not a manly man, I’m a bit camp, I’m attracted to men…. I wasn’t super feminine but I definitely wasn’t masculine. Before I didn’t want to be seen as male because I didn’t want to be seen as a ‘manly man’. I really started unpacking where my gender dysphoria came from, and I thought ‘maybe I don’t have to live this way anymore’. So I cut my hair and instantly I thought ‘yeah I’m just not doing this anymore’ and that was it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Ritchie, so before we finish today I’d like to ask – from the point you decided to detransition or to ‘stop living this way’ as you said, what was it like then from a work perspective? How supportive was work when you detransitioned?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; So as this was happening – I’d actually had an interview ‘as Abby’ and was successful and got my HEO role. So when I got the email from my new management I just said ‘By the way I’m changing my name to Ritchie’, and they’ve just been awesome about the whole situation. But they did scramble a bit as they said ‘Oh we’ve been telling people we’ve got two new fabulous women coming in’ so I just said ‘it’s fine you’re still getting two new fabulous people!’ So my new management and actually my old managers and team were all great too, but what happened in the LGBT group my department was another story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this wasn’t the cross-government network I mentioned earlier, this was the departmental LGBT network and I was actually vice chair. What I did was – because I know how the Detrans issue had affected me before – I made a very very tactical decision to say ‘I’m stepping down, I’ve got a few health issues’. And that wasn’t a lie – I have quite a few health issues from surgery and hormones as I think I mentioned earlier. And it’s not that I don’t still support my trans colleagues because I do, I just don’t have the energy and I don’t feel as strongly about the overall cause anymore. And I didn’t make a big deal when I changed my name – I even had a few people contact me and say ‘I don’t know if you know this Abby but your name’s showing as Ritchie and you might want to get that fixed’ and I’d just say ‘nah, Ritchie’s a great name isn’t it?’ and just not make a big deal out of it. But then I told one of the network leads and – I don’t want to say their name but – they said ‘well you’ve lost my support, we don’t need this anti-trans rhetoric’, just because I was talking about my detransition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But remember that guy I told you about earlier that I complained about for sharing that Detrans Awareness Day post? I don’t know what happened to him but I did write to his management and HR then and said ‘I want to withdraw all complaints I’ve made about him, I’m deeply regretful, I’m sorry I put him through this process’. I did all I could to clear his name. He’s not a vindictive guy, he’s so softly spoken, he’s the nicest man you’ll ever meet, just a nice caring individual. But I know I’d seen that one word ‘Detrans’ and I flipped. So that’s why I stepped down from the LGBT network too, I didn’t want to upset my trans colleagues because I know how I’d felt. So now I just stay away from those networks and any LGBT stuff at work, I just don’t get involved, don’t comment. Well OK, maybe I sometimes make comments about putting pronouns in signatures because I strongly feel that that shouldn’t be mandated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; OK so Ritchie I wanted to ask you something quickly again before we finish, because this actually raises an interesting point to me what you’ve just said. I’m a gay man and I’ve spoken quite a bit about how I don’t feel welcome in the LGBT networks across the Civil Service now, and how they don’t want me to have a voice…. So I know you’re saying that you felt you needed to remove yourself from that environment so as not to upset your other LGBTQ colleagues, because what you’re saying would not be welcome in these networks, so aren’t you effectively being excluded by them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, of course. But, you know my opinions are my opinions and if you had told me three years ago I would have called myself a transphobic bigot! I guess I recognise though that I can jump to extremes because I’ve got an extremely obsessive nature. But, you know, I’m glad I detransitioned. It’s probably the only obsession I’ve had that hasn’t destroyed me in some way. I’ve had a lot of growth and development from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; So finally, do you think there’s anything your department or the wider Civil Service can do to support detransitioners more? And I appreciate that’s quite a big question if you can’t answer it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s worth noting here, I think, that detransitioners are still covered under the protected characteristic of gender reassignment in the Equality Act. If you look at the wording it includes ‘anyone who has undergone a process to change their gender…’. So then in internal policy around transition and gender reassignment, you should still be allowed the time off for medical appointments. Fun fact – it’s still the same policy I’m covered under when I need this. And that’s all been confirmed by work. So from a policy side I think we’re relatively good, although I can imagine there may be confusion and uncertainty from some managers and HR staff. So policy side its fine, but support side…. Despite the fact that like I said my managers have been great… it’s still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; People in work, HR and D&amp;amp;I teams need to listen to people like you and other detransitioners I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah they do but…. They are not coming from a malicious place. They are trying to protect what they see as a vulnerable minority and they sometimes see me and those like me as ‘bad’ because of what we’re saying and doing. But we’re not bad, and the world isn’t black and white. There’s shades of grey – people need to start thinking of the nuance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Ritchie, you’ve shared a lot with us today but also I’d like to say it’s no secret that you’ve become something of a public figure, and have spoken out and done a number of interviews where you try to raise awareness of detransitioners and their stories. I know a lot of the wider issues that you’ve not talked about today as we’ve mainly focused on work, you have talked about in great detail elsewhere. So are there any particular interviews you’d like to signpost so people can find out more about your experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; [Blair] &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj3qA2A_z3w&quot;&gt;White&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_cNVkvz7ZM&quot;&gt;Viva Frei&lt;/a&gt; – they were really in depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jimmy:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Ritchie I think it’s really important for people to hear some of your wider experiences and in more detail, and I – I feel like I know so much about you! Not from when we’ve talked before but from all the interviews with you I’ve watched and listened to, and from reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://tullipr.substack.com&quot;&gt;your substack&lt;/a&gt;! But thanks Ritchie, thanks for your time today and we’re really glad to have given you this opportunity to discuss your lived experience specifically with your colleagues across the Civil Service. Is there any final message you’d like to leave us with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ritchie:&lt;/strong&gt; Just to say, thanks for having me, and JK Rowling is based! &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-02-26-gluck/">&lt;p&gt;Another forgotten hero for LGBT history month, another lesser known artist from the 20th Century, this time a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gluck&lt;/strong&gt; (born Hannah Gluckstein on 13 August 1895) was a British painter and lesbian who refused to conform to expectations: about her art, how she presented or who she loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hannah_Gluckstein_SAAM-1970.70_2.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;this link opens in a new window&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Hannah_Gluckstein_SAAM-1970.70_2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;A portrait of Gluck by the artist Romaine Brooks&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size:.8em;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A portrait of Gluck by the artist Romaine Brooks (1923-1924)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She was the daughter of Joseph Gluckstein (brother to the founders of J. Lyons and Co., the coffee house and catering empire) and had a privileged London upbringing, after which she attended St John’s Wood School of Art (1913-1916).  However, from here her life was to take anything but a conventional path.  Instead of settling into London society to marry and paint watercolours, she ran away with her fellow art student and lover, E M Craig (known by her surname, ‘Craig’).  Their destination was the Cornish artists community of Lamorna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once there, Gluck was finally free to be herself.  She smoked a pipe and rejected the prefixes that would automatically identify a woman as married or single (Miss or Mrs).  In common with some of her lesbian friends, she sometimes used a male name (in her case the names Peter and Hig).  However, she always refused the label ‘Mr’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like her life, no labels could contain Gluck’s art.  As &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/feb/08/gluck-painter-fine-art-society&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; described: &lt;em&gt;“In keeping with her personality, however, she refused to identify with any particular school or painting movement”&lt;/em&gt;.  Despite this, Gluck’s first solo exhibition in 1924, sold all fifty seven paintings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gluck wore her hair short and dressed in tailored menswear, a style popular with lesbians at the time.  This was an era before women-only dating sites, magazines or bars and to be an open lesbian was a matter of social shame and exclusion, so lesbians in the 1920’s and 1930’s had to rely on such codes to identify one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gluck was to go on to have a passionate romance with civil servant, food writer and florist &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Spry&quot;&gt;Constance Spry&lt;/a&gt;, who is likely to have been the inspiration for many of Gluck’s floral paintings in the 1930’s.  One particularly striking painting from 1936 depicts a plant known as &lt;em&gt;‘Lords and Ladies’&lt;/em&gt;.  This curious plant is in fact carnivorous.  Insects fall into the lily like tubes and drown and are dissolved in the pool of liquid in the base.  A fiercely unconventional choice of bouquet for a lady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Gluck successfully exhibited and sold her work throughout the 1920’s and 1930’s, it was her portrait known as &lt;em&gt;‘Medallion’&lt;/em&gt; (1937), perhaps her most famous, which was to cement her legacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size:.8em;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A portrait of Gluck by the artist Romaine Brooks (1923-1924)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This portrait emerged from Gluck’s relationship with Nesta Obermer, which began with a visit in May 1936 to Obermer’s family home in East Sussex.  Following this meeting Gluck concluded her relationship with Spry (and, in a very gentlemanly gesture, apparently burning Spry’s love letters on a bonfire shortly afterwards).  The relationship with Orbermer that followed was one of the most important of her life and the inspiration for &lt;em&gt;Medallion&lt;/em&gt;.  This dual portrait of Gluck and Obermer, was apparently inspired by a night out together attending Mozart’s Don Giovanni.  Described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://dianasouhami.com/book/gluck/&quot;&gt;Diana Souhami’s biography to Gluck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“They sat together in the third row and felt the intensity of the music fused them both into one person and matched their love.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medallion&lt;/em&gt; has become an iconic statement of lesbian love and identity, such that it was chosen as the 1982 cover of Radclyffe Hall’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129223.The_Well_of_Loneliness&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘The Well of Loneliness’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gluck’s love affairs were multiple and passionate.  However like many famous historical lesbians (such as both Radclyffe Hall and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Lister&quot;&gt;Anne Lister&lt;/a&gt;) those she loved were not always prepared to defy the conventions of their times.  Obermer never left her husband for her ‘wife’ Gluck.  That said, it’s probably fair to add that Gluck was not overly restrained by expectations of monogamy.  She also lived with another female lover during her relationship with Obermer.  This was the journalist Edith Shackleton Heald, who she met in 1943 and who was also lover to WB Yeats.  It was all very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after the success of Gluck’s early career, by the interwar period she was falling out of fashion.  After her relationship with Obermer ended, so too did Gluck’s art.  Although she continued her relationship with Shackleton Heald and the two moved to Sussex, she painted nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be the 1960’s before Gluck’s inspiration returned, with new paintings and a well-received solo show.  Gluck’s last major work (completed 1973) was a painting of a fish head entitled &lt;em&gt;‘Rage, Rage against the Dying of the Light’&lt;/em&gt; (a possible reference to the Dylan Thomas poem &lt;a href=&quot;https://poets.org/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night&quot;&gt;‘Do Not Go Gentle into that good night’&lt;/a&gt;).  Until the end, a woman of unconventionality, fire and defiance.  Shacklton Heald died in 1976, followed two years later by Gluck in 1978, at the age of 82.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-02-21-willem-arondeus/">&lt;p&gt;This LGBT History Month we would like to invite a celebration of some lesser known heroes who don’t always feature on the mainstream narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willem Arondeus&lt;/strong&gt; (22 August 1894 – 1 July 1943) was a Dutch artist and author and hero of the Dutch anti-Nazi resistance movement during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Willem_Arondeus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A portrait photograph of Willem Arondeus&quot; title=&quot;Willem Arondeus (1894-1943) Dutch writer, painter and partisan&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arondeus is worth celebrating as a talented artist and writer in his own right. However it is his incredible bravery which was to create his finest legacy. Not only was he openly gay at a time when homosexuality was stigmatised, but during the war he was active in the Dutch resistance, a decision that would ultimately lead to his murder by the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1942, Arondeus began an underground periodical called the &lt;em&gt;Brandarisbrief&lt;/em&gt; in which he called on artists to resist the occupying Nazi army. He later became more directly involved in the resistance, joining an underground organisation known as the ‘CKC’, creating forged documents along with a lesbian resistant Frieda Belinfante. This was important work, however the success of these forgeries was hampered by the Municipal Office for Population Registration, which checked documents and could expose their work as fakes. It was for this reason that Arondeus and others developed a daring plan to go one step further and destroy the whole Municipal office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what they did. On 27th March 1943, the building was blown up, destroying 800,000 identity cards (15% of the records), hindering Gestapo efforts to identify Dutch Jews and others wanted by the Nazis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, an unknown betrayer led the Gestapo to Arondeus, who was arrested five days later on 1st April. Brave, even under interrogation (and likely torture), Arondeus refused to betray the other resistance fighters involved. Sadly his notebook was found, and eventually the majority of the group were arrested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly three months later, on 18 June 1943, Arondeus was tried and sentenced to death, along with 13 other men who participated in the attack. Almost all were executed on 1 July 1943, save for two young doctors who received prison sentences. One possible reason for this was because Arondeus took full responsibility for the attack. Frieda Belifante was the only other member of the resistance group to survive, which she did by disguising herself as a man and going undercover. (She eventually escaped to Switzerland and then emigrating to the United States, where she became a founding artistic director and conductor of the Orange County Philharmonic, a story itself worthy of a blog.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was, however, no escape for Arondeus. In a final act of defiance and bravery, before his execution, Arondeus made sure it was known that he and two of the other men in the group (Bakker and Brouwer) were gay. His last words before his execution were: &lt;em&gt;“Tell the people that homosexuals can be brave!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1945, after the liberation of the Netherlands, Arondeus’s family was awarded a posthumous medal by the Dutch government in his honour. In 1984, he was awarded the Resistance Memorial Cross. Yad Vashem recognised Arondeus as Righteous Among the Nations on 19th June 1986.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is certainly an inspirational hero who deserves to be better known for his bravery and also for his beautiful art.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link href="/posts/2023-02-14-gay-in-the-uk/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Gay in the UK" />
      <published>2023-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</published>
      <updated>2023-02-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
      <id>/posts/gay-in-the-uk</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-02-14-gay-in-the-uk/">&lt;p&gt;I have been delighted to write this blog for SEEN, for LGB(T) History Month.. This blog particularly focuses on a potted history of gay rights in the UK as they relate to gay men, but later in the month a ‘sister’ piece will be released focusing on lesbian history. The blog covers 500 years worth of history, and shows how the rights for gay men to live and love freely are an incredibly recent occurrence within the history of the UK, still very much in living memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;from-tudor-times-to-the-victorian-era&quot;&gt;From Tudor Times to the Victorian Era&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male homosexuality was explicitly outlawed in Britain (well, actually the Kingdom of England at the time) in 1533 by King Henry VIII, in the charmingly titled Buggery Act.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Under the Buggery Act, men having sexual relationships with other men faced the possibility of being sentenced to death, and prosecutions were often brought in circumstances where men showed any affection to each other - even if there was no evidence of sexual relations between them. The law was extended to Wales in 1543, and Ireland in 1634.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Records of Scotland’s legal history prior to the union with England are more hazy, but we do know in Scotland the first prosecution for ‘sodomy’ that led to the execution of two men was in 1570, when John Litster and John Swann were strangled and then burnt at the stake.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In England, in the first 100 years of the Buggery Act’s enforcement, only one man was executed, Walter Hungerford, and as he was already on trial for treason and heresy the charge of buggery was added to ‘humiliate’ him more prior to his execution. Prosecutions for buggery where the death penalty was handed down remained rare until 1700, and only became more common after the year 1800. In the period between 1806 and 1861, there were 8921 prosecutions for buggery in England and Wales and 404 death sentences were issued, though only 56 men were executed. The last two men executed for homosexual acts in England and Wales were John Smith and James Pratt, in 1835.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ramping up of prosecutions for ‘buggery’ coincided with a growing subculture of homosexual men, particularly in larger cities and specifically in London. ‘Molly Houses’ were both secret bars and taverns for homosexual men to meet, and frequently were also brothels where men could buy sex from other men. Contemporary accounts of Molly Houses and their goings on often relied on the oft-quoted cliché that homosexual men are not real men, and the language used would today be seen as both homophobic and misogynistic. The 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century journalist Ned Ward stated,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“the men rather fancy themselves as women, imitated all the little vanities that custom has reconciled to the female sex, affecting to speak, walk, tattle, curtsy, cry, scold, and mimic all manner of effeminacy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, men of all types were known to frequent the establishments - traditionally masculine men as well as effeminate men - and men from all walks of life and social standing. While usually a safe haven, many of the prosecutions of men during the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century for buggery were the result of raids on Molly Houses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1861, the Offences Against the Person Act&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; combined a number of existing laws for England, Wales and Ireland, including the Buggery Act, and the death penalty was removed as a possible punishment&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, ‘reduced’ to a maximum punishment of between ten years and life imprisonment. The 1885 Labouchere Amendment&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; explicitly made all homosexual acts between men illegal, not just ‘buggery’, and introduced the concept of ‘gross indecency’. In 1895 it was ‘gross indecency’ rather than ‘buggery’ for which Oscar Wilde was convicted, following his sexual relationships with other men (primarily Lord Alfred Douglas) and Wilde served two years hard labour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-early-20th-century&quot;&gt;The early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, male homosexuality seemed to become more ‘tolerated’ but only in certain parts of society. Homosexual men of the upper classes that were able to live a life of relative luxury were often left to their own devices if they kept their proclivities behind closed doors. The first ‘gay bar’ as we would consider it today opened in 1912 - ‘The Cave of the Golden Calf’ - but it was open only to the wealthy and the aristocratic. The bar only lasted two years but gained a notorious reputation in that short time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the First World War, other gay bars started slowly opening up.. This coincided with the growing metropolitan elite in the media arena. Radio remained a hugely popular form of entertainment, and BBC Television launched in earnest in 1936. Playwrights, actors and musicians effectively became the new aristocracy, and it was an open secret amongst the upper echelons of society that men like Noel Coward ‘preferred the company of other men’, even if the general public remained blissfully unaware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, for every step forward, there were two steps back. Following the Second World War, arrests and prosecutions for homosexual acts between men started to increase significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Turing is now well known. He built the first model of a computer, and was hugely influential in the history of computer science. He should always have been a national hero for his work on the Enigma code, and how that helped shape the fortunes of the allied forces in WW2, but for a long time his involvement was a highly classified state secret. This was because, in 1952, Turing was convicted of ‘gross indecency’ for having a sexual relationship with another man. Given the option of imprisonment or chemical castration, he chose the latter. The chemical castration was done via the use of a synthetic oestrogen analogue, which left Turing impotent and caused him to grow breast tissue. Turing had his security clearance revoked and was barred from continuing to work with GCHQ. Following this horrific treatment, in 1954, aged just 41, Turing killed himself with a fatal dose of cyanide.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;decriminalisation-and-immediate-aftermath&quot;&gt;Decriminalisation and immediate aftermath&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the increase of prosecutions for male homosexuality post-WW2, and the high profile cases of Alan Turing and other prominent figures in the early 1950s, many senior politicians became concerned. In 1954, Winston Churchill’s Conservative government set up a committee headed by Sir John Wolfenden to look into homosexuality and other sexual offences. In 1957 the committee published a report - The Report of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution - often referred to simply as ‘The Wolfenden Report’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wolfenden Report recommended that homosexual acts between men should be decriminalised, and saw this as a civil liberties issue. The report stated: “It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private life of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour.” It also refused to classify homosexuality as a mental illness, which is notable as it was not until 1974 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (an American publication but with broad international recognition) removed homosexuality as a mental illness, the World Health Organisation (WHO) did not do so until 1992!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a long time for the report’s recommendations on decriminalising homosexuality to be implemented. There was furious opposition to the report’s recommendations, especially from religious leaders and certain sections of the press. It was 1967 when the ‘Sexual Offences Act’ passed&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, a whole decade after the report was published. This Act (applicable only to England and Wales) decriminalised sex between two men, aged 21 or over, in private, and was a true watershed moment in the history of gay rights in the UK - even if there was still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to our saturation in American culture and media, the 1969 ‘Stonewall Riots’ in New York are often overstated in their relevance to gay rights in the UK. The riots were two years after the decriminalisation of male homosexual acts in England and Wales, and at best are a footnote to gay rights in the UK. But the influence of the USA’s Gay Liberation Movement (GLF) inspired a similar group in the UK (and much later the UK organisation ‘Stonewall’ took its name from the bar where the New York riots occurred).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK GLF launched in 1970, and while it officially shut down in 1973, other organisations sprung up in its wake. The 1970s remained a hostile time for most gay men, and gay men in the media, even the most flamboyant, remained ‘in the closet’ to the general public, just as in the 1930s. Activist groups also sprang up to oppose not just gay rights groups but what they saw as society becoming corrupted by post-1960s sexual liberties. Mary Whitehouse was famously opposed to gay men having any rights or visibility in society, and the GLF disrupted her ‘Festival of Light’ in 1971. Whitehouse remained a formidable figure for the rest of her life, and in 1976 she brought a private blasphemy case against the publication ‘Gay News’&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (the first notable gay periodical in the UK, launched in 1972) for printing a poem that depicted a Roman Centurion having a sexual relationship with Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1970s, male homosexual acts remained a criminal activity in Scotland, and were only decriminalised in 1980, following the passing of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 (Section 80).&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;aids-and-thatchers-britain&quot;&gt;AIDS and Thatcher’s Britain&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culture in the 1980s saw a seismic shift in the visibility of gay men, and some men challenged traditional sexist norms of how they should act, dress and behave. While many high profile media figures who would come out later in life remained ‘in the closet’, men like Jimmy Sommerville and Pete Burns were flamboyantly and openly gay and bisexual at a time when it was still very dangerous for them to do so. But the early 1980s saw the emergence of a catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AIDS was first noted in 1981 as a mysterious disease in the USA, primarily affecting gay men. By 1983, there had been 14 known cases of AIDS in the UK - mainly men - and thereafter, diagnoses skyrocketed. An AIDS diagnosis was a death sentence. Many men died very soon after diagnosis. It was in 1984 when the virus that caused AIDS - HIV - was identified. As the 1980s grew on, more and more people were diagnosed as HIV+ or with AIDS, the overwhelming majority being gay and bisexual men. AIDS completely decimated gay communities throughout the country, and the media became overtaken with a frenzied, homophobic hysteria that targeted gay men and what was often called ‘the gay plague’. Tabloid headlines became increasingly more overtly hostile, The Sun famously running a headline stating &lt;em&gt;‘If my son gets AIDS I’ll shoot him’&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In 1986 a huge AIDS awareness campaign was launched in the UK, with actor John Hurt as the public face of it. The simple and chilling message was ‘AIDS: Don’t Die of Ignorance’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AIDS epidemic was one of the many factors that led to Mrs Thatcher’s growing concerns about homosexuality and the influence it could have on children. In 1988, her government passed Section 28 of the Local Government Act.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Section 28 stated that local authorities &lt;em&gt;“shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship”&lt;/em&gt;. The law effectively gagged school teachers from talking about homosexuality or gay relationships at all, even to older teenagers. This also effectively acted as a neat way from stopping teachers addressing often horrific homophobic bullying that was being carried out in secondary schools across the country. In 1989, gay and lesbian activists formed Stonewall UK, at the time an organisation looking to progress gay and lesbian rights in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;john-major-to-new-labour&quot;&gt;John Major to New Labour&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 1990s, AIDS was still a massive concern, especially for gay men, even if there was less public hysteria over the illness - though the tabloid press and much of the mainstream media still remained openly hostile and homophobic for much of the decade. In 1991 one of the most high profile deaths from AIDS happened when Freddie Mercury passed away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gay men’s lifestyle magazines such as ‘Gay Times’ and ‘Attitude’ had their heyday. While the former focused on more serious news items than the latter, both were heavily filled with fashion, scene issues, and a large amount of advocacy for safe sex. Condoms and safe sex pretty much defined gay male culture in the 1990s.Although advances in medicine were starting to make the HIV virus more manageable, in many cases it was still a death sentence. Most life insurance companies refused to cover any men who were or had been in a sexual relationship with another man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1994, Conservative MP Edwina Currie tabled an amendment to the Sexual Offences Act to equalise the age of consent to 16 for male homosexual sex, as it was for opposite-sex partners.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; She was unsuccessful in this venture, but instead the age of consent was lowered to 18 from 21. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1997 saw radical change in the UK when Tony Blair’s New Labour took power to the sound of ‘Things Can Only Get Better’. More advances in gay rights came at the turn of the new millennium. While Edwina Curry had been unsuccessful in her efforts at equalising age of consent laws, Blair’s Labour government did so with the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000, with Jack Straw playing a very key part in this move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Section 28’ was repealed in the year 2000 in Scotland and in 2003 in England and Wales, while the ban on gay men, lesbians and bisexual people serving in the military was lifted in 2000. While in recent years, the organisation ‘Stonewall’ has become hugely controversial as its core mission has significantly changed, it is undeniable that at the time they were hugely instrumental in the military ban being overturned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Blair’s government passed the Adoption and Children Act which made it legal for same-sex couples to adopt children, and in 2004 Civil Partnerships were introduced, allowing same-sex couples to have their relationship legally recognised and provide almost all the benefits of marriage. Blair was cautious about introducing full blown ‘gay marriage’ and at the time Civil Partnerships were seen by many as an acceptable compromise. Stonewall UK famously felt Civil Partnerships were adequate and for many years following refused to support calls for same-sex marriage. Of course, gay and lesbian people are not a monolith, and some supported gay marriage while others were opposed.. From conservatives at one end who felt, despite the fact they were gay, marriage should only be for a man and woman - to radicals at the other end who felt LGB people (gay men in particular) should not ‘ape’ heteronormativity at all or even have monogamous relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also from the late ’90s, more and more gay representation started being seen on our TV screens, and gay characters became less ‘sexless’ and more sexually active. The hugely controversial ‘Queer as Folk’ hit Channel 4 in 1999, depicting graphic scenes of sex between men, and the cult BBC Sitcom ‘Gimme Gimme Gimme’ gave comedy fans a bitchy, narcissistic and promiscuous gay man as one of the two central characters. In 2001, Big Brother winner Brian Dowling became the first openly gay man to host a children’s television show, when he landed a job on SMTV Live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2010---present&quot;&gt;2010 - Present&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many could have been forgiven for believing homophobia was a thing of the past and gay rights were now a sorted issue, especially following the legalisation of same-sex marriage in early 2014, by David Cameron’s coalition government. HIV treatment is more effective than ever, and many people on effective retro-virals are able to live long, happy lives. HIV is no longer a death sentence, but the importance of regular testing cannot be overstated. The slogan is now ‘undetectable is untransmissible’, as effective retro-virals that leave the virus undetectable means there is almost zero chance of transmitting the virus, and now there are many HIV+ men in long term relationships with partners who are HIV-. The development of PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) also means men with a particularly high risk sex life are able to further protect themselves from becoming HIV+, as if the medicine is used correctly then there is again almost no chance of being infected with the virus even if exposed to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for those of us outside of metropolitan bubbles, it is far from the case that homophobia is now ‘sorted’. In many parts of the country, casual homophobia is still a huge problem, and many same-sex couples are still too fearful to hold hands with their partner in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those that attended my speech at the SEEN launch event, or who have read the transcript&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, you will know my personal experience. In addition to the traditional homophobia we have always faced, we now see a new rise of homophobia from ‘within our own communities’ with many organisations and groups which are ostensibly for gay rights now fundamentally ideologically opposed to the very nature of homosexuality and exclusive same sex attraction. We have come a long way from the Molly Houses of the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, but places for gay men are once again moving underground and becoming more secretive. What will the future hold? Only time will tell…&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary type="html">I have been delighted to write this blog for SEEN, for LGB(T) History Month.. This blog particularly focuses on a potted history of gay rights in the UK as they relate to gay men, but later in the month a ‘sister’ piece will be released focusing on lesbian history. The blog covers 500 years worth of history, and shows how the rights for gay men to live and love freely are an incredibly recent occurrence within the history of the UK, still very much in living memory.</summary>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-01-04-why-is-seen-important-to-me/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This post is the first of &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/launch-speeches/&quot;&gt;four speeches by SEEN members&lt;/a&gt; from our launch event in October.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is SEEN important to me? To explain this, I need to go back in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now 38 years old, and I’ve known I was gay since my early teens. I was ‘out’ since I was 16 years old. Which, at the time, was pretty unusual especially living in the Welsh valleys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s incredibly embarrassing to have to say this, but when I was 16, my best female friend romantically propositioned me. I thought I could maybe give it a go as I misconstrued my strong friendship feelings for her as potentially something else, and maybe I wasn’t 100% gay after all. As it turned out, it wasn’t her hairstyle, make-up, clothes, or feminine style that turned me off – it was the reality of her female body. It seems bizarre to have to say this now, even little over 5 years ago if I said I was gay, everyone would have understood this to mean I am exclusively homosexual, an adult human male only attracted to other adult human males. Now to say I am gay apparently means something else, it means I am attracted to someone’s internal sense of masculine ‘identity’. Well this is not so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-arent-many-homosexuals-around&quot;&gt;There aren’t many homosexuals around!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homosexual people are actually quite a small minority, regardless of what people may assume otherwise.
According to the ONS’s 2020 estimates, 2.5% of men in the UK are exclusively homosexual, and 1.1% of women are.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, it’s not uncommon to see a much larger figure quoted, with suggestions that as many as 1 in 10 people are part of the ‘LGBTQIA+ community’.  The large number is in part due to the fact that the definition given of what it means to be ‘queer’ can be extremely broad, even extending to anyone who feels ‘outside the norms of society’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’m here because I want to talk specifically about homosexuality, and factoring in men and women, the amount of actual homosexual people in the population is about 1 in 56. There are also, of course, bisexual people. 1.6% of women in the UK are bisexual, and 0.9% of men are. So that means an estimated 3.1% of the population of the UK are Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual by 2020 ONS estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, because so many other people now identify as ‘queer’ or another identity, homosexual men and lesbian women are now a minority within this rapidly expanding community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;homosexual-people-are-same-sex-attracted-and-it-is-not-offensive-to-say-so&quot;&gt;Homosexual people are same-sex attracted, and it is not offensive to say so&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homosexual people are oppressed on the basis of sex. Gay men are oppressed because we are exclusively attracted to men, of the same sex. Lesbians are doubly oppressed because they are oppressed as women, their sex, and because of their attraction to other women, their same-sex attraction.  To understand this oppression, you have to understand the reality of sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex matters. As JK Rowling said – ‘if sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I am not gay because I have a particular political or philosophical belief, but only because I am exclusively same-sex attracted. No more, no less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem I have with the blanket term ‘queer’ is that it masks this important distinction.  This isn’t the only issue with ‘queer’.  Furthermore, for many homosexuals such as myself even the use of the word ‘queer’ is uncomfortable. For many of us ‘queer’ is a horrific slur that has been used predominantly against gay men. Noting in 2018 the website ‘Back2Stonewall’ ran a poll on the word queer, 93% of gay men who responded said they do not accept this word and still regard it as a slur.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;homosexual-people-do-not-all-have-the-same-beliefs-and-opinions-regardless-of-what-people-may-tell-you-otherwise&quot;&gt;Homosexual people do not all have the same beliefs and opinions, regardless of what people may tell you otherwise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with demographic shifts in what it means to be part of the community that was once LGB, there has also been a trend towards increasing conformity in what this community thinks, politically.  My own experience of  ‘gay groups’ and organisations, and sadly, most LGBT networks I’ve encountered in the Civil Service, is that there is an increased expectation that I won’t talk about the fact I’m homosexual.  This is because the phrases ‘homosexual’ and ‘same-sex attraction’ are sometimes considered ‘dog-whistles’ for bigotry.  Gay men and lesbians may be told we have to be inclusive of people who are not gay and lesbian in our groups, organisations, meetings and safe spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience of other staff networks has told me I have to listen to ‘allies’ who speak for me and spread the word that all gay people think and feel the same, and have the same political and philosophical beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true, as I said earlier, all we have in common is our sexual orientation. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to stress that these networks are perfectly entitled to exist, and I am sure many staff feel they represent them, but I needed to make the point how I do not feel they represent me, and that I am not even welcome in them, as to why SEEN is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;homosexuals-need-their-own-spaces&quot;&gt;Homosexuals need their own spaces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the broadening of what it means to be ‘queer’ groups and spaces for actual gay men, lesbians and bisexual people, are underground in a way not seen since at least the 1980s. Secret code words, handshakes, locked doors, moving in the shadows.  I know many now fear describing ourselves as homosexual lest we are ejected from the very organisations that were once set up to protect us and further our rights, because we do not necessarily share the politics of these groups&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many lesbians and homosexuals, there is a growing need for a community that understands the particular concerns and oppressions of being a gay man or a lesbian woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homosexual people must be able to protect our hard-won right to associate exclusively on the basis of our sexual orientation if we so wish, and have the right to exclude people who aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-seen-matters-to-me&quot;&gt;Why SEEN matters to me&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience of other staff networks has sadly been that I do not always have a voice, and I am not always made to feel welcome to talk about how I am homosexual, or to talk about the fact that sex is relevant to my orientation, or to not talk about homophobia in work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And SEEN allows me to express this most basic fact. And that is why SEEN is of such importance to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This network is important to me because &lt;strong&gt;no other network I have found in the Civil Service allows me to discuss or describe my lived experience or talk about any of the above points.&lt;/strong&gt;  I look to SEEN to give me a voice as a homosexual man, same sex attracted who believes in the reality of sex.&lt;/p&gt;
