      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-02-27-why-is-seen-important-to-me-iv/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This post is the last of &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/launch-speeches/&quot;&gt;four speeches by SEEN members&lt;/a&gt; from our launch event in October. The author wishes to remain anonymous.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people have a favourite Harry Potter character.  For some it’s Hermione, others perhaps Dumbledore.  I’ve always been a Luna Lovegood fan.  I liked the fact she floats slightly off synch and doesn’t care for others’ approval.  I liked the fact that she speaks the truth.  I like the fact that she doesn’t mind that she doesn’t fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to mind that I didn’t fit.  In fact, there used to be a lot of things that I minded; a lot of things I wanted to change, thinking that if these changed everything else would fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at school that I first used to think about cutting off my breasts: one after the other, until my chest was flat again, back to the pre-fall perfection of childhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at school that I discovered that the horror of menstruation could be curtailed if I restricted my food intake enough to trick my body into thinking I was starting to starve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I kept the cutting to my wrists, and my thoughts to myself.  But they were there, these secret desires to strip myself of this unwanted unfolding into a womanhood I never wanted, but which still came: uninvited with its horrors.  I thought without this everything would be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, these changes were a matter of intense misery.  So much so that by the time I left school it was a long time since I’d considered myself capable of happiness.  I accepted this was my lot.  I was just unlucky that my body and brain didn’t fit.  Most unluckily of all, I had to navigate this in silence and in solitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not realise then what I know now: how lucky I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t appreciate how lucky I was not to be promised  the one thing that I really wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t understand how lucky I was that no one told me that there was a way out.  For no one told me there might be a way to return first to childhood; or at very least to stop the fall and from there have time to think and (if I wanted) to start again.  No one told me I could then become one of the real people: one of the men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one answered my prayers, gave me a reason to stop hurting myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I was lucky because no one let me think that because I didn’t wear little dresses to go out and disco, but preferred standing with the other DJ boys at the drum and bass night in hoodies and combats, meant anything more than the fact that I really appreciated my breakbeats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I didn’t fit in, that I was awkward and perpetually out of tune.  But I was lucky because no one pointed a way to how I could be made to fit: confirmed and curtailed me through drugs and surgery that promised to make me feel ‘right’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a horrible time at school.  It was miserable.  I hated my adolescence and puberty so much I still don’t talk about them.  But I know now I was lucky because never once was I told anything but the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;*&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am older.  Many things have changed.  I’ve found my own way to navigate the complex dance between being female and expectations of femininity.  I have forgiven my body and found gratitude in what it can do.  I better understand my mind and can present as normal for almost two hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have a nephew and I recognise something in him that I once knew in myself. He’s lovely, he’s a rare jewel of a human being, not quite of this earth, half angel.  But he’s autistic odd, like me.  He does a lovely turn to Lady Gaga, makes machines and sits inside them looking into the silver-plated looking glass that belonged to an old aunt.  For a while he begged to have his limbs replaced with metal ones so he could become a cyborg.  Recently he’s started sometimes telling me he wants to become a girl, apparently he wants to go to Rainbows with his sister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days people prick up their ears at such a combination.  And there are many ways his parents could frame this behaviour.  But if they were to follow the educational resources recommended at his school, they’d quickly interpret these signs to mean that he was trapped in the wrong body and we should affirm his identity as an imperative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily they, like me, are not so sure that there are wrong bodies, any more than there is wrong skin colour or wrong brains.  There are people and they are diverse, and this diversity is complex and glorious.  But being different doesn’t mean wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad they don’t share these teaching resources with him.  I am glad no one has told him that his personality means that his body needs changing to fit. I am glad no one has told him he cannot ‘be himself’ without lifelong medication and permanent surgical damage to his body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some boys are sensitive and want to hang out with girls and wear dresses.  That doesn’t mean they need ‘fixing’.   They need to be made welcome and feel celebrated as they are.  I am glad he is being made to feel welcome as who he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; font-size: 1.5em;&quot;&gt;*&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many of you, I’ve been through the wars and having been through the wars I want to protect.  I am determined to protect those I love; those I don’t know but who I recognise as like me; and those who are not like me but I recognise are vulnerable.  I want to protect others so that they have the opportunity to grow up to be the rare, non-conforming, unconventional humans they deserve to become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not here out of hate, or out of anger, or out of fear.  I’m here because the truth matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one should lie, even if those lies are designed to be kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one – especially children – should ever be encouraged to believe the lie that they can change sex, and that damaging their bodies will take away their unhappiness.  Lies are complex structures that require constant complex shoring up.  And however hard we try, everyone eventually comes to understand that they have been lied to, and that is a terrible thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the kindness that I have received in life, gentleness and honesty are among those I most cherish.  And we owe the most vulnerable the respect of honesty, of speaking the truth.  Everyone deserves that gift.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-01-25-why-is-seen-important-to-me-iii/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This post is the third of &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/launch-speeches/&quot;&gt;four speeches by SEEN members&lt;/a&gt; from our launch event in October.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-loss-of-the-word-woman&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Loss of the Word Woman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to speak about language – primarily the loss of the word ‘woman’ to describe an adult human female  - and its emotional impact on me. Language matters and the loss of our words hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen a quiet dismantling over the past few years across our public institutions (including the Civil Service) of sex-based language. By ‘quiet’ I mean that it’s happened without any consultation with the group it primarily impacts – women. It starts by replacing the word ‘sex’ (the material fact of being male or female) with the word ‘gender’ (the social roles and stereotypes associated with either sex) and ends with the word ‘woman’ being routinely separated from our female bodies or reproductive functions, and suddenly we find ourselves referred to as cervix-havers, menstruators, birthing parents, lactators, bodies with vaginas, pregnant people or ‘people experiencing the menopause’. These examples aren’t one-offs - they are now seen regularly in NHS information campaigns, women’s health charities, corporate advertising, Civil Service policies, networks and newsletters, and mainstream media news reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon isn’t restricted to the UK. Women’s Declaration International&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which reaffirms women and girls’ sex-based rights as set out in CEDAW (Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women) recognises that in relation to protecting women’s sex based rights including reproductive rights, protection from male violence against women, participation in sports and the need for single-sex spaces, we are unable to safeguard women’s rights effectively while at the same time, twisting our language to include men.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The words ‘gender neutral’ and ‘inclusive’ might sound positive and well-intentioned and may be intended as a way to avoid hurting anyone’s feelings, but in considering the feelings of one group  - those who find sexed language problematic - we give real pain to another group.  When women say that erasing the words we use to describe ourselves and our reality is painful, (and we do say this) why are we not listened to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about my feelings.  When I see or hear any of these female body-part or reproductive function terms such as ‘pregnant people’ instead of ‘pregnant women’, or ‘anyone with a cervix aged 25-64 ’ instead of ‘women aged 25-64’ I experience distress and rage, my heart rate speeds up, my chest tightens, and I feel nauseous. I consciously calm myself before I decide whether to ignore it or to challenge with a &lt;em&gt;‘We are women. Call us women.’&lt;/em&gt; There’s a real emotional cost either way – ignore it and I lose self-respect and feel I lack courage; challenge it and I know I will either be ignored, or receive a dismissive &lt;em&gt;‘this organisation uses inclusive language’&lt;/em&gt; response, which implies it’s my reaction that’s out of kilter, or that my concern is not valid or that my views are fringe. Challenging in a public space can sometimes mean being called unkind, hateful, out-of-touch, or even fascist. Such accusations might be made out of a misguided desire to be kind and accommodating to others but they are often intended to ostracise, alienate and instil fear.  They prevent reasonable discourse and aim instead to silence, to shame and to control. And it works – I know many women who say nothing out of fear. And all this just for believing that adult females should be called women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does my anger at this language, which has surprised me by its strength, come from and why does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was brought up to be a feminist  by a single mother. She would say the personal is political. My emotion doesn’t come out of nowhere. I was a child in the 60s and 70s and learned from a young age that women have had to fight to achieve social and political equality with men, that our biological reproductive role, and vulnerability to male violence, mean that we sometimes require additional legal protections and safe spaces to achieve equality and that one of the reasons girls and women have struggled to achieve parity with men is that men control language. ‘Man’ in the Bible includes ‘Woman’ or does it? The ‘Rights of Man’ – to vote, to speak, to own property, to organise politically &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; include women but it often did not. Whether we were included or excluded was sometimes hard to discern and out of our control. Women were invisible, subsumed by the male default, and separately defined only in relation to men. Our names belonged to our fathers, then our husbands and our history became harder to trace. We began to understand this and for a few short decades that coincide with my life, we started to reclaim female language, history and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, in a sudden reversal of progress, that I and many others did not foresee, the word ‘woman’ is routinely used to mean – not an adult human who is female, as understood by humanity for thousands of years and as defined in the Equality Act 2010 - but to mean anyone of either sex who says they’re a woman. So women as a separately defined sex class are, if not invisible, then blurred and ill-defined. This hurts because the words woman along with girl, mother, daughter and sister are precious. I remember the charity SANDS - which supports anyone affected by the death of a baby - putting out a communication on social media which did not use the word ‘mother’ once, instead saying ‘parent’ or ‘birthing parent’. This was done in the name of ‘inclusion’. The number of responses from bereaved women anguished at not being called ‘mothers’ was heart-breaking and led SANDS to back down and apologise to those women. Such ability to listen to the strength of this emotion and reflect seems sadly to be rare. Women now have to lobby and complain to each individual organisation, employer and charity just to persuade them to use the word ‘women’ and even then it usually falls on deaf ears which teaches us a lesson. It teaches us that the opinions and feelings of women matter very little to institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mothers and grandmothers achieved so much, and social and political parity appeared to be within sight by the 1980s. And now this. We are at risk of losing the language which describes our sex as based in material reality. If that happens, we will have no collective means to describe our female experience or to combat inequality. I despair when I hear the fight to retain abortion rights in the US framed as the ‘rights of people capable of becoming pregnant’. Imagine if the suffragettes had been hamstrung by language that was so inclusive that instead of “Votes For Women!” they’d felt obliged to say ‘Votes for people with a cervix!’  A battle cannot be won without clear and ringing language - ‘A Vindication of The Rights of Woman’!&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We find ourselves now having to fight just to protect and define the word ‘woman’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are tempted to think that language has changed simply to reflect a more inclusive and equal society, ask yourself why you rarely, if ever, see men referred to either by the NHS or the Civil Service as ‘prostate owners’ or ‘sperm providers.’ They are just called men! Why? In one recent newsletter in my own civil service department  I saw that one staff event referred to &lt;em&gt;‘people going through the menopause’&lt;/em&gt;, and another event on the same page referred to &lt;em&gt;‘men’s mental health.’&lt;/em&gt; Particularly ironic when mental health issues are experienced by both men and women and the menopause exclusively by women. We are experiencing a new and insidious form of sexism and exclusion that comes disguised as inclusion and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see invisibility shrouding women one short generation after the battle for sex equality seemed to be all over bar the shouting. I say sex equality, never gender equality. I, like millions of women, have experienced girlhood, female puberty, womanhood, pregnancy, childbirth, motherhood, breastfeeding and menopause. These are all experiences exclusive to the female sex. I attended the traumatic and frightening birth of one grandson. My daughter and I knew what being a woman meant during that night and day. It is real. It is not an identity, a feeling or a costume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling women birthing parents, menstruators and ‘people going through the menopause’, is not only dehumanising and insulting but it has the catastrophic psychological effect of dividing women from each other. What does a menstruator have in common with a ‘person experiencing the menopause’ or with a 70-year-old cervix-haver or with a birthing parent? Unless we can say without any qualification that ‘of course they are all women’, the effect is that they have nothing in common other than their humanity which we share with boys and men, and we have broken the cherished link that all girls and women, young and old, mothers or childless, and with or without various reproductive experiences, have in common with each other as we pass from childhood to old age and which we do not share with any boy or man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want SEEN to be a place in the Civil Service where women can say all of this without fear of censure and to remind every HR department and policy maker to think carefully about whether reducing women and girls to a multiplicity of body parts and functions is kind or inclusive at all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-01-10-why-is-seen-important-to-me-ii/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This post is the second of &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/launch-speeches/&quot;&gt;four speeches by SEEN members&lt;/a&gt; from our launch event in October. Named individuals are anonymised.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good afternoon everyone, I am one of the Co-Chairs of the new Network.  It gives me great pleasure, on behalf of myself, my-Co-Chairs and the rest of our steering group, to welcome you all today to the first meeting of the new Civil Service Sex Equality and Equity Network and I’d like to thank you all for coming.  I’ve opened and chaired meetings with that form of words on many occasions, but it has rarely been so whole-heartedly true as it is today.  This gathering and the formation of this network is something that a group of us have been looking forward to for quite a while.  We have all, for different reasons, felt that there has been a gap in the activities that take place to promote diversity in the Civil Service in that they do not recognise the existence and legitimacy of those of us who consider that there will always be circumstances where sex is important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a number of us are lawyers, and we all start from the position that civil servants should uphold the law in all our dealings.  The central focus of our network will be on the sex-based rights and protections that the law provides.  As we state in our constitution: “we will focus on challenging sex discrimination, and upholding rights and protections that relate to sex (including the protections provided to those with the protected characteristics of sex and sexual orientation).  We recognise that ensuring sex equality and equity sometimes requires treating women and men differently, according to our different rights”.  Because the law is so central to what we stand for, we are fortunate enough to have a lawyer who specialises in discrimination law, here this afternoon to give a brief introduction to some of the legal provisions that create and support sex-based rights and protections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also committed to the protected belief (covered by the protected characteristic of religion and belief in the Equality Act 2010) that biological sex is binary and immutable, that biological sex matters for both women and men in our everyday lives, including for many of our rights and needs in the workplace, and that biological sex must not be conflated with the concepts of gender identity or gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What will this mean in practice in terms of the goals we will pursue as a network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It means, for example, that we will push for the Civil Service to collect accurate and meaningful data on the protected characteristic of sex.  Because of the importance of data in understanding inequalities and acting to achieve sex equality, we have also invited a colleague who specialises in statistics, to speak briefly on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also means that we will advocate for workplace policies and practices that contain clear sex-based language, where relevant.  To this end, we are also fortunate to be hearing from one of my colleagues on the topic of language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in addition to a clear understanding and application of the law, data and language, an understanding of our network would not be complete without an appreciation of the experiences which have drawn many of us to have an interest in this field.  So, you will also hear testimonies from other SEEN members as to why the formation of this network is important to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll give you may own - rather mundane - personal story in a moment, but I wanted to start by explaining a bit more about why we have set up this network and what we hope it will achieve.  I hope most of you will be able to relate to our motivation and support what we want to accomplish.  We have deliberately kept the guest list for this event small and largely limited to people who have contacted us because they wanted to be part of something like this, so that we have the confidence to share experiences here.  But we have some guests who are involved in Diversity and Inclusion in the civil service and hope those guests will also understand and support what we are trying to do in the interests of promoting greater diversity and inclusion in the civil service.  By encouraging a range of voices to speak up and create an open and respectful dialogue, we aim to achieve greater tolerance between those with differing beliefs and experiences and ‘foster good relations between people who share particular protected characteristic and those who do not’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone should have their legal rights and interests properly respected and protected in the workplace.  We recognise that this includes those who disagree with us.  Conversely, just because others may disagree with our protected beliefs, this is not an excuse to vilify us or try to restrict the exercise of our legal rights.  We will strongly resist such an approach.  Amongst our aims is to promote understanding between people with different beliefs and ensure that the civil service properly caters for those who hold all of them, balancing them where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We very much hope that all those aims will be achieved by this network coming into existence and we intend to make good use of the voice that the network will give us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now turn briefly to the personal and explain why I care so much about this.  There are three main reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, because I regard the substitution of sex with gender identity in relation to equality aims as a retrograde step for women’s rights.  When I was starting out on my career, my father told me that he was worried about the cost of educating girls and that if I incurred debts in the course of my training, it would give me a ‘negative dowry’, a very sexist and demeaning viewpoint which I did not allow to throw me off course.  Then my uncle, who was a solicitor, told me that he would offer a training contract to my husband, and not to me, because being a trainee solicitor involved lots of ‘out-door work’ and so was not suitable work for a woman! We’ve collectively proved him wrong, more than 50% of solicitors are now women and that percentage is even higher in the civil service.  I have personally proved him wrong by having a successful career as a lawyer.  Both of these views were based on harmful stereotypes in relation to the role of women in society.  I am concerned that an insistence on the idea that everyone has an innate gender identity is a way of allowing those types of stereotype, which until a few years ago I thought were well on the way to being eradicated, back into society by the back door.  The concept of gender identity, whilst proponents describe it as an internal feeling, is difficult to separate from societal expectations of how each sex is expected to behave.  As someone who does not consider I have a gender identity, the idea that if I do not conform to the societal expectations for my sex, I may actually be of a different sex or even gender, seems highly regressive.  If this serves to reinforce, rather than rid us of such unhelpful stereotypes, the consequences for the equality of women, and indeed for all gender non-conforming people, for equity in our society to the benefit of both sexes seem to me to be highly damaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I care because of the impact on single-sex services for women.  In my spare time I was for many years the chair of the board of a charity running a women’s refuge.  In the course of that work, I met and my organisation helped many severely traumatised women and their children by providing a safe refuge and a service provided by women and for women, taking advantage of an exception in what is now the Equality Act 2010.  Refuge services are a strong example of the importance of sex-based rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst of course not all men are abusers, it is surely contrary to a tradition of recognising the need for single sex provision in this are, to up to date evidence on perpetrators and victims and to much good-practice in trauma-informed health care to require female victims of male abuse and their children to live in close proximity to biological male victims, no matter how they identify.  Any traumatised victim is likely to feel unsafe and more traumatised in such an environment, and where biological sex dictates having different needs in any event, such a practice would have been likely to undermine the effectiveness of the service our charity provided (particularly given such services could instead be provided more effectively in separate facilities).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue is not directly relevant to the work of this network which will focus on where they are important in our Civil Service workplaces, but it is part of what motivates me to care about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I also care about the impact of the difficulty of speaking up about sex-based rights on my gay and neurodiverse colleagues and friends, but I’ll let colleagues speak to that shortly.  Please be aware that they cover some sensitive topics in a frank fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve set out why we are setting up this network and given you a flavour of my personal motivation.  Some of my colleagues are now going to address specific aspects of our aims and offer you an insight into their motivations.  We’ll take a brief break for networking in the middle of the speaker slots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have heard from them we’d like to lead a more participative session about the network and its plans.  We’ll try to answer questions but please don’t ask for more personal information from our speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a note about context.  We want our network to recognise freedom of speech and hope you will feel comfortable to share your views.  I am sure you will all express yourselves sensitively though and bear in mind that this is a meeting of an official civil service network and so we need to abide by the Civil Service Code and conduct ourselves accordingly as I am sure you will.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/2023-01-04-why-is-seen-important-to-me/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This post is the first of &lt;a href=&quot;/tag/launch-speeches/&quot;&gt;four speeches by SEEN members&lt;/a&gt; from our launch event in October.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is SEEN important to me? To explain this, I need to go back in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now 38 years old, and I’ve known I was gay since my early teens. I was ‘out’ since I was 16 years old. Which, at the time, was pretty unusual especially living in the Welsh valleys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s incredibly embarrassing to have to say this, but when I was 16, my best female friend romantically propositioned me. I thought I could maybe give it a go as I misconstrued my strong friendship feelings for her as potentially something else, and maybe I wasn’t 100% gay after all. As it turned out, it wasn’t her hairstyle, make-up, clothes, or feminine style that turned me off – it was the reality of her female body. It seems bizarre to have to say this now, even little over 5 years ago if I said I was gay, everyone would have understood this to mean I am exclusively homosexual, an adult human male only attracted to other adult human males. Now to say I am gay apparently means something else, it means I am attracted to someone’s internal sense of masculine ‘identity’. Well this is not so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-arent-many-homosexuals-around&quot;&gt;There aren’t many homosexuals around!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homosexual people are actually quite a small minority, regardless of what people may assume otherwise.
According to the ONS’s 2020 estimates, 2.5% of men in the UK are exclusively homosexual, and 1.1% of women are.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, it’s not uncommon to see a much larger figure quoted, with suggestions that as many as 1 in 10 people are part of the ‘LGBTQIA+ community’.  The large number is in part due to the fact that the definition given of what it means to be ‘queer’ can be extremely broad, even extending to anyone who feels ‘outside the norms of society’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I’m here because I want to talk specifically about homosexuality, and factoring in men and women, the amount of actual homosexual people in the population is about 1 in 56. There are also, of course, bisexual people. 1.6% of women in the UK are bisexual, and 0.9% of men are. So that means an estimated 3.1% of the population of the UK are Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual by 2020 ONS estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, because so many other people now identify as ‘queer’ or another identity, homosexual men and lesbian women are now a minority within this rapidly expanding community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;homosexual-people-are-same-sex-attracted-and-it-is-not-offensive-to-say-so&quot;&gt;Homosexual people are same-sex attracted, and it is not offensive to say so&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homosexual people are oppressed on the basis of sex. Gay men are oppressed because we are exclusively attracted to men, of the same sex. Lesbians are doubly oppressed because they are oppressed as women, their sex, and because of their attraction to other women, their same-sex attraction.  To understand this oppression, you have to understand the reality of sex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex matters. As JK Rowling said – ‘if sex isn’t real, there’s no same-sex attraction’.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I am not gay because I have a particular political or philosophical belief, but only because I am exclusively same-sex attracted. No more, no less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem I have with the blanket term ‘queer’ is that it masks this important distinction.  This isn’t the only issue with ‘queer’.  Furthermore, for many homosexuals such as myself even the use of the word ‘queer’ is uncomfortable. For many of us ‘queer’ is a horrific slur that has been used predominantly against gay men. Noting in 2018 the website ‘Back2Stonewall’ ran a poll on the word queer, 93% of gay men who responded said they do not accept this word and still regard it as a slur.&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;homosexual-people-do-not-all-have-the-same-beliefs-and-opinions-regardless-of-what-people-may-tell-you-otherwise&quot;&gt;Homosexual people do not all have the same beliefs and opinions, regardless of what people may tell you otherwise&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with demographic shifts in what it means to be part of the community that was once LGB, there has also been a trend towards increasing conformity in what this community thinks, politically.  My own experience of  ‘gay groups’ and organisations, and sadly, most LGBT networks I’ve encountered in the Civil Service, is that there is an increased expectation that I won’t talk about the fact I’m homosexual.  This is because the phrases ‘homosexual’ and ‘same-sex attraction’ are sometimes considered ‘dog-whistles’ for bigotry.  Gay men and lesbians may be told we have to be inclusive of people who are not gay and lesbian in our groups, organisations, meetings and safe spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience of other staff networks has told me I have to listen to ‘allies’ who speak for me and spread the word that all gay people think and feel the same, and have the same political and philosophical beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true, as I said earlier, all we have in common is our sexual orientation. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to stress that these networks are perfectly entitled to exist, and I am sure many staff feel they represent them, but I needed to make the point how I do not feel they represent me, and that I am not even welcome in them, as to why SEEN is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;homosexuals-need-their-own-spaces&quot;&gt;Homosexuals need their own spaces&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the broadening of what it means to be ‘queer’ groups and spaces for actual gay men, lesbians and bisexual people, are underground in a way not seen since at least the 1980s. Secret code words, handshakes, locked doors, moving in the shadows.  I know many now fear describing ourselves as homosexual lest we are ejected from the very organisations that were once set up to protect us and further our rights, because we do not necessarily share the politics of these groups&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many lesbians and homosexuals, there is a growing need for a community that understands the particular concerns and oppressions of being a gay man or a lesbian woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homosexual people must be able to protect our hard-won right to associate exclusively on the basis of our sexual orientation if we so wish, and have the right to exclude people who aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-seen-matters-to-me&quot;&gt;Why SEEN matters to me&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience of other staff networks has sadly been that I do not always have a voice, and I am not always made to feel welcome to talk about how I am homosexual, or to talk about the fact that sex is relevant to my orientation, or to not talk about homophobia in work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And SEEN allows me to express this most basic fact. And that is why SEEN is of such importance to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This network is important to me because &lt;strong&gt;no other network I have found in the Civil Service allows me to discuss or describe my lived experience or talk about any of the above points.&lt;/strong&gt;  I look to SEEN to give me a voice as a homosexual man, same sex attracted who believes in the reality of sex.&lt;/p&gt;
