  <li>to challenge poor treatment of members where they ask us to challenge systemic issues that are considered to impact SEEN members</li>
  <li>to protect our members from harassment</li>
  <li>to collect demographic data on members, or on their opinions. This data will only be collected and reported in anonymous form.</li>
</ul>
