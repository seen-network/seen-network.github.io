For this year's _International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women_ SEEN is publishing articles today and in coming days by four of our general members.

**Trigger warning:** As these blogs are to mark the IDEVAW, they necessarily refer to violence against women including domestic abuse, rape and femicide.
