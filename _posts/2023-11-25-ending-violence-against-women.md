For this year's _International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women_ SEEN is publishing articles today and over the next few days by four of our general members (outside our network leadership team), three of whom must remain anonymous.

**Trigger warning:** As these blogs are to mark the IDEVAW, they necessarily refer to violence against women including domestic abuse, rape and femicide.

#### [#1  _"16 days of activism"_](/posts/2023-11-25-idevaw-16-days-of-activism/)

Our first post sets out some of the very sobering facts around this _"oldest and most pervasive of problems"_, and delves into its societal context.

#### [#2  _"The judicial system is trying â€“ is it succeeding?"_](/posts/2023-11-26-idevaw-is-the-judicial-system-succeeding/)

Benjamyn Damazer in Department for Business & Trade reflects on the shifts he has witnessed in his long experience as a magistrate and special constable.

#### [#3  _"A personal account"_](/posts/2023-11-27-idevaw-a-personal-account/)

A SEEN member shares the powerful and moving story of her experience survivng an abusive relationship, and its ongoing impact on her life.

#### [#4 _"Language matters"_](/posts/2023-11-28-idevaw-language-matters/)

The final post examines the recent trend towards censoring sex-based language - in particular _'woman'_ and _'women'_ - and how this hinders efforts to end violence against women and girls.
