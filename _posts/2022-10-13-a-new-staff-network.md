We are happy to announce the launch of our new UK cross-government staff network, the _Sex Equality and Equity Network_.

SEEN is a staff network committed to promoting and supporting sex equality and equity between women and men in our workplaces, and helping all staff to thrive at work and fulfil their potential. The focus of our network is on challenging sex discrimination and upholding sex-based rights (including the protected characteristics of sex and sexual orientation, as set out in the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents)).  We recognise that to achieve this and ensure sex equality and equity sometimes requires treating women and men differently, according to our different rights and needs.

We are also committed to the protected belief (covered by the [protected characteristic of religion and belief](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/10) in the Equality Act 2010) that biological sex is binary and immutable, that biological sex matters for both women and men in our everyday lives, including for our rights and needs in the workplace, and that biological sex must not be conflated with, or replaced by, the concepts of gender or gender identity.

As a part of our mission we want civil servants to feel safe to exercise their legal rights under the European Convention of Human Rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and association, provided they manifest their rights lawfully and respectfully and within the [Civil Service Code](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code).  We wish to encourage a diversity of voices and open and respectful dialogue and tolerance between those with differing beliefs and experiences.

We also aim to be a source of expertise for staff on the protected characteristic of sex, pregnancy, maternity and sexual orientation; as well as the importance of taking these fully into account to meet staff rights and needs, including through the development of workplace policies and practices.  We also plan to hold events and webinars in due course.

SEEN membership is open to staff who share our values, from central government departments, agencies, and their associated public bodies including armâ€™s length bodies.

If you would like to learn more about our mission, or to be added to our mailing list, please get in touch: [contact details available very shortly].
