We’re delighted that SEEN is inspiring like-minded associations in other sectors, public and private.  We very much hope the trend will continue until all sectors and workplaces offer ways for gender critical and sex realist staff to convene, discuss concerns and share best practice.

This is a list of all Sex Equality and Equity Networks (or similar) that we are aware of.  If you are aware of any others please [drop us a message](/contact/) to let us know.  We should be clear that the other networks and groups are fully independent and autonomous initiatives, though broadly equivalent to SEEN in terms of their goals.
